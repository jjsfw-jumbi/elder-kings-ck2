## Atmora overhaul

- [x] New static content: trade republic, titles, better county flags
- [-x] Atmora exodus/survival
    Right now Atmora is very comfy place to live, once Draugr threat is daealt with.
    This is in direct disagreement with lore - atmora is freezing and should die off unless
    some countermeasures are taken.
    Player should be able to either:
    [ ] Organize massive exoduds
    [x] Organize trade route through permafrost to southern lands.
    [ ] There should be depopluation mechanics for Atmora

- [ ] Overhaul religious features for animism, maybe change description. 
    They should have access to thuum, companions had many tongues among them.
    Its very likely that atmorans did continue using thuum without help of greybeards.

- [ ] Thuum flavour, some siege event is desperatly needed, a guy blowing door with it's thuum or something


## Stabilization and blob prevention
Imho quite a big problem for gameplay is a tendency for certain groups to dominate map.
Redguards, Orcs, Aldmeri Domion frequently conquers large parts of map, which causues for game
to become boring quite quickly since there are not many agents with freedom of action.

I suggest weighting CBs according to "cultural profile" and make ai much more reactive (focus on upholding status quo)
instead of conquest unless it fits the cultural profile and given culture has a ambitious leader.

### Cultural conversion changes
Curent culture conversion mechanics should be have AI logic at the decision level to slow down culture conversion.
Some (cultures, titles) should be marked cosmopolitan (empire?) others nationalistic (aldmer, aldmeri domionion).
Currently only way of cultural conversion has a ai weights, which still means that everyone IS making culture conversion.
