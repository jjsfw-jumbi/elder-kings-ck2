confucian_bureaucracy_desc;One and the same as the Daedric Prince who rules over it, this is not a mundane state with a mortal government, but a plane of Oblivion located far beyond the boundaries of Mundus.

oblivion_isolationist_desc;For some reason, this Daedric Prince is utterly disinterested in mortal affairs and has withdrawn more fully back into Oblivion. Even contacting them is nearly impossible.;;Aus für Sterbliche unerfindlichen Gründen, ist dieser Daedrische Prinz derzeit vollkommen desinteressiert an Nirn und seinen Bewohnern und hat sich nach Oblivion zurück gezogen. Selbst ihn zu kontaktieren ist fast unmöglich.;;;;;;;x
oblivion_interactive;Interactive;;Offen;;;;;;;x
oblivion_interactive_desc;This Daedric Prince is currently quite interested in the goings-on of Nirn and is open to making bargains with mortals. Summonings and offerings frequently succeed in attracting this Prince's attention.;;Dieser Daedrische Prinz ist derzeit besonders interessiert an den Machenschaften der Sterblichen auf Nirn.

Dies könnte sogar zu einer Invasion Nirns führen!;;;;;;;x
oblivion_normal;Ascendant;;Aszendierent;;;;;;;x
oblivion_normal_desc;This Daedric Prince revels in their power and authority, as their realm is stable and their mortal servants many. Their realm is currently in its status quo, with a massive army of Daedra willing and able to fight at a moment's notice, but lacking the cause to do so.;;Dieser Daedrische Prinz ist auf dem Höhepunkt seiner Macht - sein Reich ist befriedet, seine Diener sind zahlreich. Unter seinem Befehl steht eine gewaltige Armee, doch ohne einen Grund wird sie nicht nach Nirn kommen.;;;;;;;x
oblivion_apogee;Triumphant;;Triumphierend;;;;;;;x
oblivion_apogee_desc;This realm of Oblivion is abuzz with the activities of its lesser Daedra, and the ruling Prince is confident in their ability to project power upon Nirn.

oblivion_convalescing_desc;This Daedric Prince is in a state of recovery, having recently been thwarted in a major intervention upon Nirn or their plane destabilised by an internal cataclysm.

Der Prinz hat nicht die Macht oder den Willen, seine Gunst den Sterblichen zu erweisen.;;;;;;;x
oblivion_cataclysm;Cataclysmic;;Katastrophe;;;;;;;x
oblivion_cataclysm_desc;This Prince's realm of Oblivion is in the midst of a major crisis, with its inhabitants thrown into disarray as the Prince is preoccupied with sorting matters out.

Die Bewohner bekämpfen sich gegenseitig, da der Prinz zu beschäftigt dazu oder einfach nicht interessiert daran ist, den Frieden zu wahren. Bis die Krise beendet ist, wird sich der Prinz nicht auf Nirn zeigen.;;;;;;;x

thras_open;Open;;;;;;;x
thras_open_desc;The Thrassian kingdoms are at peace and interested in communicating with land-dwellers. Those who pique their interest can easily convince them to get involved in surface politics.;;;;;;;;;x
thras_isolationist;Isolationist;;;;;;;x
thras_isolationist_desc;It is difficult to open up lines of communication with the kingdoms of Thras. The Embassy has effectively been shuttered - while lines of communication have not been completely severed, interacting with the Coral Kingdoms is certainly a more challenging matter.;;;;;;;;;x
thras_expansionist;Expansionist;;;;;;;x
thras_expansionist_desc;The Sload have adopted an aggressive military policy, favouring territorial expansion and the subjugation (or elimination) of surface-dwellers. Subjects may find it easy to draw them into wars, while neighbors who refuse to submit to the Coral Kingdoms may be targeted for invasions.;;;;;;;;;x
thras_stable;Stable;;;;;;;x
thras_stable_desc;The Sload are currently experiencing the status quo. The Thrassian realms are divided, but coordinated enough to be a significant threat to anyone who draws their ire. Subtle economic or military changes could mean a radical shift in the status of Thras.;;;;;;;;;x
thras_booming;Booming;;;;;;;x
thras_booming_desc;A single monarch has gained substantial leverage over the other Thrassian kings and queens, temporarily uniting them under one banner - it is unknown how long this will last.

thras_internal_war;Internecine War;;;;;;;x
thras_internal_war_desc;Various Thrassian kingdoms are currently locked in all-out war. Reports from Thras are unreliable, but are consistent in their accounts that the brutality of the conflict has severely weakened even the most powerful Sload monarchy.;;;;;;;;;x
thras_invaded;Invaded;;;;;;;x
thras_invaded_desc;Someone or something has launched an attack against the kingdoms of Thras, attacking their homeland directly. The Sload have thus been forced to divert all available manpower and magickal resources to Thras, and are keen to gain any allies who may be able to alleviate their precarious situation.;;;;;;;x
thras_recovering;Recovering;;;;;;;x
thras_recovering_desc;Severely weakened due to military conflict, Thras is in the midst of a recovery. It is highly unlikely that the Sload will be able to participate in any military expeditions any time soon, and are lacking in financial and economic strength, as well. It will take some years before the status quo is resumed.;;;;;;;x

tribunal_convivial;Convivial;;;;;;;x
tribunal_convivial_Desc;Temple faithful are jubilant about the activity of this Tribune, who wanders the world seeking adventure, promoting the virtues of the Temple, and aiding the common people whenever possible. This Tribune's disposition is such that they have even been shown friendliness toward heathen outlanders, welcoming them as tourists to their Fane.;;;;;;;;;x
tribunal_cordial;Cordial;;;;;;;x
tribunal_cordial_desc;Neither stirred up for war nor particularly focused on traveling the world, this Tribune has mostly kept to their home Fane, but is amenable toward visiting pilgrims and has no qualms about intervening in worldly affairs if needed.;;;;;;;x
tribunal_withdrawn;Withdrawn;;;;;;;x
tribunal_withdrawn_desc;Isolated within their inner sanctum and only willing to speak with their closest confidants and attendants, this Tribune has displayed a greatly decreased interest, and possibly efficacy, in the goings-on of the outside world.;;;;;;;x

EKArdor60;At the shrine of [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName], a small ethereal chest materializes. I open it up and gaze upon the treasure before me.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor60Accept;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor100;A portal opens up in front of me and a stately Dremora falls out, landing on even footing. The Dremora drops to one knee and bows. "[From.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName] has heard your plea, and I have been sent to aid you. I am your loyal servant, [Root.GetFirstName]. Command me, and I will follow your direction.";;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor100Accept;Loyal servant, you say?;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor110;A swirl of energy engulfs me, only for it to disappear moments later. [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName] speaks. "As you have proven a capable servant, I grant you the power to be even more capable in your deeds. Go then, mortal.";;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor110Accept;Yes...I can feel the power!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor120;A gate to Oblivion opens up and a small army of Daedric warriors storm out. "In the name of [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetFullName], we serve you, [Root.GetBestName]." The Oblivion gate collapses in on itself, but the warriors remain and stand at the ready.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor120Accept;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor130;I start to feel an unusual sensation, and glance at my hands. Sinew and skin are rebuilding before my eyes, looking like they did at the moment my transformation into Lichdom was first completed.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor130Accept;My decay is cured!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor131A;The wretched price of undeath is too great for me to pay. I have invoked Clavicus Vile, Prince of Wishes, and he responds to my request, restoring my flesh to pristine condition. "Right," Clavicus says. "There you are! Decay halted and reversed. As good as new.";;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor131B;The wretched price of undeath is too great for me to pay. I have invoked Clavicus Vile, Prince of Wishes, and he responds to my request, rending the flesh from my body and leaving only bone! "And there it is," Clavicus notes with a laugh. "Your decay is gone! And you've lost some weight.";;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor131OptA;My decay is cured!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor131OptB;I am a skeleton!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor133;Looking to undo the decay that I suffer, I have called upon Namira. But rather than curing my decay, she offers me a choice. "It is true that I can cure this," Namira notes, "There is no reason to. I can ensure this decay never ends - that you will not rot away for good, but forever putrefy. Choose this, and you shall have my favour.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor133OptA;Just cure the decay. I have no wish to remain like this!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor133OptATooltip;Your decay is cured and you return to normal...for now.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor133OptB;I accept your offer!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor133OptBTooltip;Your decay is held in stasis, never to worsen but never to be cured.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor135;To stop my foul decay, I have petitioned Peryite, Prince of Pestilence, for assistance. "Look upon your body," Peryite says, as my body is refreshed before my very eyes. "And so as this ailment ends, yet more curses arise upon the mortal plane." When I return home, my guards inform me that hordes of monsters and beasts have suddenly taken residence within the realm.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor135OptA;A small price to pay for a cure for decay.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor200;[From.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName] speaks to me with purpose. "So you, [Root.GetFirstName], wish me to extend my might and conquer Nirn? Yes, this can be done. And I shall do it. But realise this, mortal - these Daedra that I shall send ultimately serve in my name, not yours. You are but my emissary. You may rule this world, but only at my discretion!" At that, a great gate to Oblivion erupted from the ground. Across the horizon, I could see another. And then another. And from each, an army of Lesser Daedra rushed out.;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor200Accept;I am unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor210Title;Daedric Invasion!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor210;Reports are coming in from the lands of [From.GetFirstName] of something frightening - gates to Oblivion have begun to spring up out of nowhere, with hordes of ravenous Daedra pouring out and laying waste to the surrounding countryside. The Daedra are united under the banner of [From.GetFirstName], who appears not to be acting independently, but as an agent of [FromFrom.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName], who allegedly seeks to conquer the mortal world and rule over it eternally!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor210OptA;I will submit to [FromFrom.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s rule!;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor210OptB;I will follow [FromFrom.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName], but in secret...;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor210OptC;I will keep up appearances, but I have no wish to follow [FromFrom.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x
EKArdor210OptD;Time to ready for the coming storm...;;;;;;;;;x
EKInvasionResolution60;The Daedra have me surrounded, but their numbers grant them no advantage - I slaughter them all. After the battle, I sense that there is more to be done.;;;;;;;;;x
EKInvasionResolution60Accept;[FromFrom.GetBestName] must be vanquished!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal15;To the [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nIt is with great appreciation that I accept your charitable donation to the Temple. I assure you that this act of kindness will not go unnoticed - or be forgotten.\n\nSigned, [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal15Accept;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal25;I've just commissioned a mural of [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName] that will, hopefully, succeed in capturing [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetHerHis] stately elegance. It will be some time before the artists arrive at my court to begin their assignment.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal25Accept;I hope the artists hurry up!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal27;The painters have finally arrived and have begun outlining the mural. Before they commit to actually painting it, however, they've asked what sorts of materials I would like them to use in producing the painting.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal27OptA;I'm on a budget. Use cheap, basic pigments.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal27OptB;Let's use something eye-catching.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal27OptC;I want paint made with gold and crushed gemstones!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal29;The painting is nearly done. There are just a few final details that need to be worked out - in particular, [FromFromFrom.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName] face. A respected master painter has caught word of our project and has volunteered to finish the mural...for a price.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal29OptA;No, I don't think we'll be doing that.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal29OptB;By all means! Your assistance would be appreciated.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal29OptC;I am a master painter in my own right. I will handle this!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal30A1;The mural is finally complete! The unveiling ceremony seems to go well, although the guests remark that the portrayal of Lady Almalexia is rather pedestrian. Nonetheless, a representative sent by Ayem assures me that my gesture of piety will not be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal30A2;The mural is finally complete! At the unveiling ceremony, the painting of Lady Almalexia is revealed to a round of applause - the guests agree that the finished product is a fine representation of Mother Morrowind. A pleased representative sent by Ayem informs me that this work of art has earned me some recognition.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal30A3;The mural is finally complete! During the unveiling ceremony, the audience responds to the painting of Lady Almalexia with thunderous applause. "Awe-inspiring" is one of the many complimentary words used to describe the work of art.

EKTribunal30C1;The mural is finally complete! The unveiling ceremony seems to go well, although the guests remark that the portrayal of Lord Vivec is rather pedestrian. Nonetheless, a representative sent by Vehk assures me that my gesture of piety will not be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal30C2;The mural is finally complete! At the unveiling ceremony, the painting of Lord Vivec is revealed to a round of applause - the guests agree that the finished product is a fine representation of the Poet.

EKTribunal30Accept;I stand with the Temple!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal50;At daybreak, guards enter my cell and shackle me, leading me to a platform outside before a gathered crowd that boos my entry. [From.GetBestName] declares that I am to be tried for acts of heresy against the Tribunal Temple. The trial is short, with various witnesses being called to testify at my supposed offenses. At the end, [From.GetFirstName] scowls at me and readies a weapon. "You, [Root.GetFirstName] are judged guilty of all charges, and are hereby sentenced to death! But, I recall the acts of mercy performed by [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName] and I am inspired. You shall not die today, [Root.GetFirstName]! Remember that [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s example has spared you!" I am immediately released, and escorted away from a now-cheering crowd.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal50Accept;At least I'm still alive...;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal52;In the morning, I preside over a trial for [From.GetBestName] who is accused of acts of heresy against the Tribunal Temple. A number of witnesses appear, each testifying against [From.GetFirstName] in a very brief affair. At the end, [From.GetFirstName] is convicted and the appropriate penalty is nothing less than death. But, I declare to the crowd that [FromFrom.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s merciful nature has inspired me, and, emulating the splendid behaviour of our Tribune, I hereby release [From.GetFirstName] to roaring applause.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal52Accept;Remember [FromFrom.Offmap.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s example!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal302;Three blessings, [Root.GetFirstName].\n\nI have heard your plea, and I shall personally aid our people. I shall do this expediently, with my utmost resolve, and you and your people will be troubled no longer.\n\nSigned, [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal302Accept;Wondrous news!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal305Title;[tribune_peacemaker.GetFirstName]'s Quest;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal305;The disasters threatening my people have been eradicated seemingly overnight. It is confirmed that [tribune_peacemaker.GetFirstName] traveled through the land, slaughtering all that stood against [tribune_peacemaker.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal305Accept;How fortuitous!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal310Title;Ordinators Arrive!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal310;My efforts to gain the assistance of the Ordinators have borne fruit. A squadron belonging to the Order of War has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], intent on hunting down subversives within the realm. They will also assist any vassals who are sworn to the Temple.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal310Accept;Heresy will be eliminated!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal310Clearance;The Ordinators are dispersed throughout the realm...;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal311Title;Ordinators Arrive!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal311;Ordinators originally requested by [From.GetBestName] arrived at court today. They are searching for enemies of the Temple with the intent of promoting religious conversion and suppressing religious unrest.;;;;;;;;;x

EKTribunal325Title;Temple Crusaders;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal325;As the Temple faithful are threatened, [tribune_crusader.GetFirstName] has rallied an army determined to drive the infidel outlanders away. Noble warriors, battle-hardened mercenaries, summoned Daedra, and hastily-armed pilgrims have all answered the call, mustering in [Root.Capital.GetName] and chomping at the bit to go to battle.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal325Accept;ALTADOON DUNMERI!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal340Title;Almalexia's Grace;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal340;[almalexia_here.GetFirstName] appears at my court suddenly, greeting me with a smile. "I have heard your plea, and I am moved," she says. "Fear not, my child. The soul sickness within you can be defeated - and I will be its vanquisher! Magicka pulses from her hands, surrounding me in an aura...and dissipating. Suddenly, I feel an incredible clarity of mind. After I give my thanks, Almalexia bids me farewell and departs.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal340Accept;Soul sickness threatens me no more!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal345Title;Sotha's Mirror;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal345;[sothasil_here.GetFirstName] appears before me as if from out of nowhere. "You have asked to be granted power," the Sorcerer remarks. "I will not withhold this from you. I am, after all, a mirror, and this is what you seek - what you need." He casts a spell upon me and nods. "Now, you too, shall be a mirror, reflecting all that is thrown at you." I give my thanks, and Sotha Sil disappears into thin air moments later.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal345Accept;I feel great power coursing within me!;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal350Title;Vivec's Touch;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal350;While I hold court, [vivec_here.GetFirstName] approaches me. "I see that you are indeed ill, [Root.GetFirstName]. There is no need for you to suffer, or to perish here. Treat your enemies well, and your friends even better - and count yourself among the latter." Vivec touches both of his hands to one of my shoulders, just for a moment. Magicka courses through me and I feel my ailment disperse! He lowers his arms and smiles. We exchange farewells, and the Poet takes his leave.;;;;;;;;;x
EKTribunal350Accept;I feel incredible!;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapInvasion10;Something horrrible has happened. It started with a few Daedra here and there falling to the ground and fading into the ether. But now all of them are gone...vanished without a trace. My army. My invincible army...;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion10DAlt;All around the world, reports arrive of Daedric hordes fading away. We have not suffered a major attack for days from the forces of the invading Prince, and all their portals to Oblivion seem to have disappeared. It seems the invasion is over. Mundus is safe once again.;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapInvasion10Alt;Peace, for the time being...;;;;;;;;;x
EKOFFMAPINVASION10ALT_CT;The Daedric Hordes will §Ydisappear§! and the invading Prince will be greatly weakened for decades...;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion40A;Fast asleep, the peaceful darkness of a night's rest is interrupted by a terrible vision - gates of Oblivion swarming with Daedra, as the world is slowly destroyed. In the midst of this, a voice beyond description calls me to vanquish this evil, and I wake up, sweating.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion40B;Fast asleep, the peaceful darkness of a night's rest is interrupted by a terrible vision - gates of Oblivion swarming with Daedra, as the world is slowly destroyed. In the midst of this, a voice beyond description calls me to vanquish this evil, and I wake up as a guard unlocks my cell door. "Your ransom's been paid. You're free to leave.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion40Accept;I need to get some fresh air...;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion55;Just as I step outside, a small group of peasants flee past me, screaming in terror. As I look in the direction they came from, I witness a group of Daedra rushing straight for me! I feel compelled to draw my weapon, and I rush toward the Daedra to meet them.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion55Accept;I do not fear death this day!;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion57;Several of my scouts have informed me that the would-be hero, [From.GetBestName], is dead at the hands of my army!;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapInvasion59;The Daedra have me surrounded, but their numbers grant them no advantage. I slaughter them all without even breaking a sweat. After the battle, a voice calls out to me.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion59Accept;Who are you? Show yourself!;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc1;"Impressive. Most impressive. Perhaps you are what I seek...and perhaps I may offer you what you seek. Azura, that ostentatious and self-indulgent fool, believes her champion can conquer this world. She disregards my own power, which she will regret. I, Nocturnal, will grant you a boon, and with it, you will dispatch her champion. Then, with my aid, you will travel to Moonshadow and end this little vanity of hers.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc2;"Well now! Where have YOU been all my life? That's a trick question on account of my immortal permanence, in case you wrap your puny little brain around that one, which will lead to imminent and painful DEATH if you try to do it literally! An introduction - I am Sheogorath, Prince of Madness and many things more. Azura is ALWAYS trying to make herself seem more important than she is, and how can you be more important than to cause the end of life as you mortals know it? Maybe we should do something about that. Make a statement! Kill her champion, then pay her a lovely visit for tea and cookies!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc3;"You fight bravely, much more so than the so-called 'warriors' who trot out in their armour and flee at the first sign of danger. Perhaps then you are the one who can act as my mortal champion. Boethiah sends forth an army with the intention of conquering the world in which you live. Now is the time for me, Malacath, to strike and have lasting vengeance! With my counsel, you will defeat her champion and banish her army. Only then can you confront him in Attribution's Share, and you WILL succeed with my aid.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc4;"They were weaker than you are. Harmless and hapless before you. Yes, you will serve me. I, Molag Bal, Prince of Domination, have use for you. The seditious snake Boethiah dares to claim supremacy on the mortal plane with his worthless army. She is mistaken. Imbued with a taste of my strength, you, mortal, will annihilate his champion. Then I will send you to her realm, where you will make him submit to ME.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc5;"You bear in you a true hunter's heart. This is most fortuitous, mortal, for I have a task befitting one of your capabilities. I am Hircine, Lord of the Hunt, and my quarry is Clavicus Vile. He predates upon the mortal world with his army, but now I shall turn the hunt against him. Serve as my hound, sniff out and kill his champion, and then we will begin the chase in Clavicus Vile's own realm. What say you?";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc6;"You fight bravely, much more so than the so-called 'warriors' who trot out in their armour and flee at the first sign of danger. Perhaps then you are the one who can act as my mortal champion. That craven weasel, Clavicus Vile, no longer content to exploit and befuddle the mortal plane, now aims to conquer it directly. I, Malacath, am not amused. With my counsel, you will defeat his champion and banish his army. Only then can you confront him in his realm, and you WILL succeed with my aid.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc7;"Sorry to crash the victory party, mortal. But I think you'll like what I have to offer! I'm Sanguine, Prince of Debauchery, and you're the perfect wingman for what I have in mind. Hermaeus Mora is BORING. How boring is he? So boring that even HE got tired of reading his damn books that he's launched an invasion of Nirn! An unexpected defeat would make his days a little less monotonous, if you catch my drift? But first, I'd like to grant you a little present and deliver some festivities to his mortal champion...";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc8;"Once more do we meet. Do not be surprised, for every night you dream, you convene with me, Vaermina. I have a task for you, which you will accomplish. The conceited Hermaeus Mora wishes to bathe the world in restless research once his armies have conquered it. This is...an unpleasant thought. I will guide you, and you will put a stop to his proxy's efforts. Then you will go to Apocrypha and you will stop -his- efforts.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc9;"Greetings and good day, mortal! A fine job there. But let us skip the pleasantries and get down to business. I am Clavicus Vile, and perhaps we could strike a bargain. I sense that you desire power, and I desire to have Hircine - the insufferable beast that he is - taught a lesson. If I grant you a boon, do for me a favour - KILL his champion to dispel that infernal army of his. Then, I shall send you to the Hunting Grounds. Defeat him there and this charade will be over once and for all.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc10;"Well met, mortal. I am Namira, and you may be of use to me. As even the mightiest hunter fells their prey and feasts victoriously, nature takes its toll. The fallen carcass feeds the decomposers, and even the hunter itself eventually is devoured by the jackals and the vultures. So too shall Hircine fall before me. Kill his champion, with my blessing, and then I shall send you to the Hunting Grounds to defeat Hircine himself.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc11;"Your ferocity is exceptional. Perhaps I will name you one of my Chosen? I am Boethiah. Frail and stubborn Malacath thinks he can relive lost glories with a conquest of the mortal realm. What folly! One more I will crush him beneath my heel. I will strengthen you, and you will slay his champion. Once this is done, make your way to the Ashpit and deal the final blow that will restore him to humility and prove my supremacy once again.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc12;"Greetings and good day, mortal! A fine job there. But let us skip the pleasantries and get down to business. I am Clavicus Vile, and perhaps we could strike a bargain. I sense that you desire power, and I desire to have Malacath - that honourable oaf - shown the error of his ways. He thinks brute strength and forwardness solve everything. Oh, how wrong he is! If I grant you a boon, do for me a favour - KILL his champion to dispel that infernal army of his. Then, I shall send you to the Ashpit. Defeat him there and this charade will be over once and for all.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc13;"Sorry to crash the victory party, mortal. But I think you'll like what I have to offer! I'm Sanguine, Prince of Debauchery, and you're the perfect wingman for what I have in mind. It's hard to appreciate good fun until Mehrunes Dagon shows up and decides that he wants to destroy everything! We can't let that happen, now can we? With my help, you'll be putting a stop to that. But first, I'd like to grant you a little present and deliver some festivities to his mortal champion...";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc14;"Well now! Where have YOU been all my life? That's a trick question on account of my immortal permanence, in case you wrap your puny little brain around that one, which will lead to imminent and painful DEATH if you try to do it literally! An introduction - I am Sheogorath, Prince of Madness and many things more. Now I love wanton destruction as much as the next guy. A little more sometimes. But Mehrunes Dagon is taking it too far with this invasion of his! Maybe we should do something about that. Make a statement! Kill his champion, then pay him a lovely visit for tea and cookies!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc15;"Impressive. Most impressive. Perhaps you are what I seek...and perhaps I may offer you what you seek. Mephala thinks of herself as sly and cunning, but her overbearing pride betrays her guile. So much so that now she has thrown away all secrecy to launch this desperate attack. I, Nocturnal, will grant you a boon, and with it, you will dispatch her champion. Then, with my aid, you will travel to the Spiral Skein and end this pathetic display of hers.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc16;"And so as the Lesser Daedra defy the balance of the Aurbis, they are put in their place. Greetings, I am Peryite. Oblivion itself is threatened by an imbalance which must be solved. Mephala oversteps her natural bounds of secrecy and this cannot stand. With my aid, you will see to it that this is rectified. Of course, there is the matter of her zealot's invasion force. Kill this champion first, then we shall proceed to the Spiral Skein.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc17;"They were weaker than you are. Harmless and hapless before you. Yes, you will serve me. I, Molag Bal, Prince of Domination, have use for you. Meridia expects that she will claim rulership over the mortal world, and believes that she can purify Nirn of my corrupting influence. She is wrong on both accounts. Imbued with a taste of my strength, you, mortal, will annihilate her champion. Then I will send you to her realm, where you will make her submit to ME.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc18;"Well met, mortal. I am Namira, and you may be of use to me. The mortal world festers with filth, but the haughty Meridia cares little for this truth. If she succeeds in her bid to secure Nirn as her own, so many of the wretched and unclean will be destroyed. Kill her champion, with my blessing, and then I shall send you to the Coloured Rooms to defeat Meridia herself.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc19;"Your ferocity is exceptional. Perhaps I will name you one of my Chosen? I am Boethiah. That pompous and naive fool, Molag Bal, believes that this little invasion of his will convince the rest of us of his primacy. He is wrong, and you will show him why. I will strengthen you, and you will slay his champion. Once this is done, make your way to Coldharbour and deal the final blow that will bring him to his knees and leave his tail tucked between his legs.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc20;"I bid you greetings, mortal. My name is Meridia. The forces of foul Molag Bal threaten to profane the mortal world in unconscionable ways, and this is an atrocity which I shall not permit. With my protection, track down his champion and purify Nirn of their presence. Then I shall take you to Coldharbour, where you will radiate my cleansing light upon Molag Bal and his abominable servants.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc21;"You bear in you a true hunter's heart. This is most fortuitous, mortal, for I have a task befitting one of your capabilities. I am Hircine, Lord of the Hunt, and my quarry is Namira. She believes that this mortal world is hers to take, but she is no more than a lowly scavenger against an apex predator such as myself. Serve as my hound, sniff out and kill her champion, and then we will begin the chase in the Scuttling Void. What say you?";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc22;"I bid you greetings, mortal. My name is Meridia. The forces of foul Namira threaten to pave the mortal world with the kind of squalor that the undead hordes thrive in. I will not permit this. With my protection, track down her champion and purify Nirn of their presence. Then I shall take you to the Scuttling Void, where you will radiate my cleansing light upon Namira and her abominable servants.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc23;"Fair greetings. You have within you a great potential I, Azura, Prince of Dusk and Dawn, wish to unleash upon Nirn for its infinite benefit. Nocturnal has dispatched an army to rule this world, but she overestimates her powers. I wish to send you - enhanced with my own power - after her champion. Put an end to the misguided pawn's actions and I will transport you to the Evergloam. Confront and defeat Nocturnal, and your world will be saved once more.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc24;"Salutations little mortal. You may know me as Mephala. You have a certain...violent streak...that may be of some use. It is ironic and ever so sad how Nocturnal claims to care little for this world, yet now she sends her hordes to claim it as her own. Her little act fools no one, least of all, me. With my guidance, you will send her back from whence she came. First, kill the servant who leads her armies. Second, travel to Evergloam and cut Nocturnal down to size. She will not expect this.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc25;"Salutations little mortal. You may know me as Mephala. You have a certain...violent streak...that may be of some use. Peryite wears the mask of complacency, pretending to be so concerned with maintaining the traditional hierarchy and status quo, but he basks in hypocrisy, which he will regret. With my guidance, you will send him back from whence he came. First, kill the servant who leads his armies. Second, travel to the Pits and cut Peryite down to size. He will not expect this.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc26;"Once more do we meet. Do not be surprised, for every night you dream, you convene with me, Vaermina. I have a task for you, which you will accomplish. Peryite thinks of himself as one who rules with truth and balance and aims to do so in the mortal realm. His ethics are figments of the imagination in dreams, and now I will bring forth a waking nightmare that will shatter his perceived reality. I will guide you, and you will put a stop to his proxy's efforts. Then you will go to Apocrypha and put a stop to this endeavor.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc27;"You stand before me as my pawn and my servant. I state this as I, Hermaeus Mora, know what was, what is, and what will be. As his forces invade the mortal world, Sanguine presents an unpleasant future - one where those live as slaves to ignorance and hedonism, rather than to knowledge. This will interfere with my own plans, which I will not allow. Dispel his army by eliminating his pawn, and then travel to the Myriad Realms of Revelry. Surpass Sanguine then and there, and victory will be mine.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc28;"You. Mortal. Listen to me. The spineless lecher Sanguine wishes to claim your mortal world as his own and thinks he can take it by force to immerse it into debauchery. This is an insult that I, Mehrunes Dagon, will not let stand! Devastation is the only means and the only end. The only festival worth celebrating is a mess of blood and wholesale destruction, which I bid you to unleash upon his pathetic servant! Accomplish this task, then go to the Myriad Realms of Revelry. Deal a cutting blow that he will not soon recover from.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc29;"Fair greetings. You have within you a great potential I, Azura, Prince of Dusk and Dawn, wish to unleash upon Nirn for its infinite benefit. Sheogorath plans to bask the mortal world into madness if his invasion is successful. I wish to send you - enhanced with my own power - after his champion. Put an end to the misguided pawn's actions and I will transport you to the Shivering Isles. Confront and defeat Sheogorath, and your world will be saved once more.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc30;"You. Mortal. Listen to me. Sheogorath is a gibbering buffoon not worthy of respect, and now he thinks he can conquer the mortal world and plunge it into sputtering lunacy. This is an insult that I, Mehrunes Dagon, will not let stand! He lacks ambition, and the art of war requires a sharp mind, singular in purpose, which he lacks! Now he faces the might of Mehrunes Dagon, which I bid you to unleash upon his pathetic servant! Accomplish this task, then go to the Shivering Isles. Deal a cutting blow that he will not soon recover from.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc31;"You stand before me as my pawn and my servant. I state this as I, Hermaeus Mora, know what was, what is, and what will be. Vaermina has deigned to attack this mortal world, in such a fashion as her nightmares will become more and more of reality. A world of endless sleep and nightmares is a world in which mortal study will be brought to a standstill. This will interfere with my own plans, which I will not allow. Dispel her army by eliminating her pawn, and then travel to Quagmire. Surpass Vaermina then and there, and victory will be mine.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion60Desc32;"And so as the Lesser Daedra defy the balance of the Aurbis, they are put in their place. Greetings, I am Peryite. Oblivion itself is threatened by an imbalance which must be solved. Vaermina oversteps the realm of dreams and now seeks to take Nirn, and this cannot stand. With my aid, you will see to it that this is rectified. Of course, there is the matter of her zealot's invasion force. Kill this champion first, then we shall proceed to Quagmire.";;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapInvasion100Desc1;"Well done, mortal," Nocturnal calls to me. "With the head of the invasion cut off, it is now time for you to confront Azura. The sudden loss has weakened her, and she is vulnerable. Now is your time. Off you go to Moonshadow!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc2;"Splendid! Just splendid!" Sheogorath's voice exclaims. "I haven't seen a bloodletting so riveting in at least one of your mortal generations! Now then, on to the next matter. Azura's a bit weak in the knees from all the trouble you've caused. Time to pack your bags and pay her that visit I mentioned! Oh, and do tell her that I said HELLO, would you?";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc3;"Excellent work, mortal," says Malacath. "I will not mince words. Boethiah is severely weakened but will not be for long. Use this opportunity to attack her. Face him and triumph! It may be your only chance.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc4;"A pathetic foe, no match for you," Molag Bal says. "And you have more important matters. Now I will send you to Attribution's Share. You will defeat Boethiah. And this wretched display will be over with.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc5;"And so more prey is felled," Hircine's voice notes. "But do not rest on this triumph, for your greatest quarry is at his most vulnerable. Strike at Clavicus Vile now, and dispel this invasion to bring our hunt to a close.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc6;"Excellent work, mortal," says Malacath. "I will not mince words. Clavicus Vile is severely weakened but will not be for long. Use this opportunity to attack him. Face him and triumph! It may be your only chance.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc7;"Bravo! What a performance!" Sanguine calls out. "And now for the final act. Oh but you've been entertaining, do you know that? Hermaeus Mora's strength wanes, and this is the best time to go to Apocrypha and perform the grand finale!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc8;"Sublime, little mortal," Vaermina's voice says. "But do not bask in your glory. You have one final task, and that is to defeat Hermaeus Mora while he is weakened. Do not tarry. I will send you to Apocrypha now.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc9;"Now that IS something," Clavicus Vile notes. "So far you've held your end of the bargain, but let's not stop there. I'll send you to the Hunting Grounds. Stop this invasion once and for all by striking at Hircine while he's weak!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc10;"Fine work," says Namira. "While Hircine is weakened, his invasion is far from over and you would do well to strike now to stop it altogether. I shall transport you to the Hunting Grounds.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc11;"You make short work of your opposition," Boethiah's voice declares. "Do hope that you do not slip. Now you must face Malacath, while he is vulnerable. Prepare to travel to the Ashpit. Do not fail.";;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapInvasion100Desc24;"A swift kill, how wonderful," Mephala's voice says. "Now little webspiner, there is another task which stands before you. I will take you to the Evergloam, and you will defeat Nocturnal to bring a swift and silent end to this invasion.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc25;"A swift kill, how wonderful," Mephala's voice says. "Now little webspiner, there is another task which stands before you. I will take you to the Pits, and you will defeat Peryite to bring a swift and silent end to this invasion.";;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapInvasion100Desc27;"Ah, excellent," says Hermaeus Mora. "With the collapse of his army, Sanguine is greatly weakened and his little invasion can be brought to a screeching halt. I shall whisk you away to his Myriad Realms of Revelry, and you shall defeat him. So say I, Hermaeus Mora.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc28;"Another weakling killed," Mehrunes Dagon notes. "Sanguine's army is crushed and dissipated, and he sits at a fraction of his power. There is no better time to strike at him. I will take you to the Myriad Realms of Revelry. Do not waste time in this matter. Crush him!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100Desc29;"A tyrant's life has been brought to a close," Azura declares. "Now I shall guide you to the Shivering Isles, where the weakened Sheogorath must be brought to defeat. Succeed in this, mortal, for many are counting on you.";;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapInvasion100Desc32;"We march ever closer to restoring the balance," Peryite says. "Yet there is one last task. That is to defeat Vaermina in Quagmire. I will send you there. Time is of the essence, mortal.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion100B;With the defeat of [FromFrom.GetFirstName], [FromFrom.GetHerHis] army has been destroyed and banished back to Oblivion.

EKOffmapInvasion102OptB;I must find the Amulet of Kings!;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Title;A Battle in Oblivion;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc1;I find myself in a palace of roses, complemented by a landscape that is picturesque beyond description. A robed woman, radiating with energy, stands in front of me. "First you slay my champion and banish my army, which I, Azura, had appointed to bring forth a new era of wisdom and beauty beyond mortal comprehension. Not only do you reject this," she says, "But you have the nerve to assail me here? Enough! I will end your life, arrogant mortal. And I will not be stopped.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc2;I find myself in a rocky, volcanic wasteland. A violent storm rages in the skies, and amidst the lighting stands a towering, caped warrior brandishing a two-wielded battleaxe, looking down at me. "You truly thought that I was weak enough for you to triumph against? Fool! I am Boethiah, Prince of Deceit, and you have fallen into my trap. You fight in my realm, and this will be the last place you ever draw mortal breath!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc3;I find myself in a green meadow, dotted with emerald hills and glowing in the warmth of midday sun. Nearby I see a strange little man with horns, flanked by a hound, smiling at me. "Welcome, welcome!" he greets me. "I am Clavicus Vile. It is a pleasure to finally meet you! You think of yourself as a great warrior, come to my home to rid your mortal world of my corrupting influence, save the day...and all that rot. My apologies, mortal. But I'm so sorry! I can't let that happen.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc4;I find myself on a stone walkway surrounded by a roiling sea of sickly-green ooze that stretches to the horizon in every direction. The sky is likewise green. Above me is a great, writhing mass of black ink, eyes and tentacles. All the eyes gaze at me. "So. You are the one who has slain my mortal pawn and now you deign to challenge me, Hermaeus Mora? You have made a grievous mistake which you will regret for an eternity.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc5;I find myself in a conifer forest in the dead of night. The dark sky and thick foliage restricts most visibility, but in the shadows, I notice a tall humanoid being with the head of a stag, wielding a spear. The being steps forward and speaks. "I bid you welcome, hunter. You have tracked down and slaughtered my champion, and have followed the trail to my Hunting Grounds. But I, Hircine, am the greatest hunter, and you, regardless of prowess, are my prey. Nonetheless, I shall honour you after I kill you.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc6;I find myself floating in a turbulent storm of ash and smoke. The power that sent me here, fortunately, has bestowed upon me the ability to breathe despite the debris. Visibility is poor, but I can see a gigantic warrior, almost like an Orc, emerging from the dust to speak to me. "Your bravery is admirable, mortal. To stand up against certain odds yet still defeat my army, my champion, and now travel here to do battle with Malacath? You are a worthy opponent. But not worthy enough to triumph against me!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc7;I find myself in a desolate land of lava flows. The air is frigid and choked with sulfur, while the ground beneath is almost too hot to tolerate. In front of me is a massive, four-armed humanoid being, who looks down at me, eyes ablaze. "So you think of yourself capable to stand against Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Destruction? You will not stop me, mortal. All you have gained by showing here is a quick and painful death!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc8;I find myself in a grim, misty, cavernous place. The sky is a sickly grey - in fact, so is nearly everything else. In the midst of all this stands a female figure, many-armed and draped in bleached white skulls. She stares at me, smiling. "It is you. The mortal hero, so adept in wriggling free of my webs and righting the discord I spread through the world. You have come to pull the last thread and end this altogether? Oh, but I am so drained by your actions. Strike at me. There is nothing I can do...or is there?";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc9;I find myself on a rocky island in a luminous, iridescent sky. In the centre of the island is a being of pure energy, in the form of a woman. Frowning, she speaks tersely. "I, Meridia, wish to bring nothing more than a balance of life that scorns the curse of undeath and protects your mortal world from its corruption. And you oppose this? You are either seditious, an idiot, or both. Either way, I cannot allow you to ruin your world. I will save it.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc10;I find myself in a cold, craggy, lifeless landscape. The frigidity is so intense that it almost burns. Emerging from the icy azure plasm is a towering, horned monstrosity carrying a huge mace, staring me down with contempt. "Pathetic, insolent weakling! You dare to challenge me, Molag Bal, in all my power? You truly believe that because you felled my mortal proxy, you are somehow worthy to face me? That you insult me so will do you no credit. Your suffering will not soon end!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc11;I find myself in a fragmented, shadowy plane with a purple, starry sky. Out of one of the shadows steps a hooded figure enveloped by a swirling cloud of dust and filth. "So you have found your way here. You wish to...clean up my mess...so speak. It is not your place, mortal. Your world has become a hotbed of pride, arrogance, and self-hatred. I, Namira, will tear down that facade. You will not succeed against me, mortal.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc12;I find myself in a dark, twisted place. It is nearly impossible to see anything in the dimness, though a hooded, robed woman is illuminated in its midst. "Your coming here was no surprise, mortal. Fortune has smiled on you and brought you to me, so that I, Nocturnal, may personally dispatch you and put a stop to your meddling. Once that is taken care of, no interlopers will be able to challenge me or my plans.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc13;I find myself in a sullen, red-skied wasteland. Lava flows here and there, and the smoke billows up into a storming sky. From a rocky outcropping slinks a sickly-looking draconic being, which rears its head down to gaze at me. "How unusual. The Pits are not a place for mortals, and you do not belong here. Especially you. Your interference with my carefully-laid plan is intolerable, and likewise your presence. I will destroy you, and perhaps then I can carry on in my goals.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc14;I find myself in a dark, summertime woodland. The air is hazy and smells of perfume, incense, alcohol and blood. From behind one of the trees steps a being almost like a Dremora, but grander in stature and covered head to toe in armour. "An uninvited guest. A party crasher who has to be bothered on my merrymaking! I, Sanguine, just want to make the mortal world a little livelier, can you really argue against that? Oh well. This is going to hurt you a lot more than it's going to hurt me, rest assured!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc15;I find myself in a throne room hewn from strange, beautiful stone blocks. Standing up from the throne is a well-dressed, bearded man with rather peculiar eyes. He grins as he furrows his brow. "Greetings! Hello! Welcome! Goodbye! You're the bearer of a nifty, one-way ticket to the Shivering Isles, and I, Sheogorath, Prince of Madness, am your one-Daedric-Prince welcoming party! And what present might I have for my favourite hostile visitor? Why, a swift, gruesome, beautiful and imminent DEATH!";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Desc16;I find myself in a nightmarish canyon below a dark purple sky. Horrible sights sprout out of nowhere, only to suddenly disappear. Among these appears a masked, robed figure carrying a staff. "Ha, most impressive. Not only have you stalled my invasion, making short work of my servant, but you've made it all the way here, fully conscious! Of course it's all been for nothing. I won't allow you to live and delay my plans any longer.";;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion105Accept;It is time to end this!;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion110;The battle with [offmap_duel_foe.GetFirstName] goes on for what must be hours. I avoid every single one of [offmap_duel_foe.GetHerHis] attacks, pushing them back and counterattacking over and over. Eventually, I see a sign of weakness and deliver a strike that not only connects, but appears to rip [offmap_duel_foe.GetFirstName] apart at the metaphysical seams! A huge burst of energy is released and I am sent flying, backwards, hurtling with the speed of a meteor.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion110Accept;Everything is going dark...;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc1;I wake up in a dark, twisted place. It is nearly impossible to see anything in the dimness, though a hooded, robed woman - Nocturnal herself - is illuminated in its midst. "Well done, mortal," she says. "Azura is defeated, and weakened to a degree that she will not soon threaten your mortal world. I shall send you back where you belong. Keep my boon. Use it well, to learn the secrets of your world." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc2;I wake up in a throne room hewn from strange, beautiful stone blocks. Standing up from the throne is a well-dressed, bearded man with rather peculiar eyes - Sheogorath himself. He grins as he furrows his brow. "WONDERFUL! Now that Azura's power has been reduced by that much more, her influence on your meager mortal plane has gone POOF! Here yesterday, gone hence! And with her temporarily out of the picture, I can get to work on a variety of neat little projects. A painting! I'll start with a painting! Blood on canvas, I think. Anyway, I think it's time you went away. And keep my present. Use it well! Or don't. Ta-ta!" The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc3;I wake up floating in a turbulent storm of ash and smoke. The power that sent me here, fortunately, has bestowed upon me the ability to breathe despite the debris. Visibility is poor, but I can see a gigantic warrior - Malacath - emerging from the dust to speak to me. "Well done. Boethiah is reeling, but remain vigiliant. She may once again trouble this world with his power. You have proven yourself worthy, and a rightful champion in my name. Keep the gift I have bestowed upon you, for there is no servant among your kind more deserving, and I will send you on your way." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc4;I wake up in a cold, craggy, lifeless landscape. The frigidity is so intense that it almost burns. Emerging from the icy azure plasm is a towering, horned monstrosity - none other than Molag Bal - carrying a huge mace, staring me down with contempt. "How disgraceful. The 'Deceiver of Nations' indeed! Felled by a feeble, mortal hand. Boethiah will not soon live this one down. That's good, at least. You've amused me, cretin. Keep my boon. Use it to sow hatred and despair in the mortal world. Despite your failings, you still exceed your peers. Somehow." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc5;I wake up in a conifer forest in the dead of night. The dark sky and thick foliage restricts most visibility, but in the shadows, I notice a tall humanoid being with the head of a stag - Hircine! - wielding a spear. Hircine steps forward and speaks. "Well met, mighty hunter. And well done. Your cunning, alacrity and strength are beyond mortal compare - and rightfully so, to topple Clavicus Vile. He will lick his wounds and no doubt be back to pick at the scraps of mortal weakness. But that will not be for some time. I shall send you back to your world. And keep my gift. It will be a worthy complement to your arsenal." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc6;I wake up floating in a turbulent storm of ash and smoke. The power that sent me here, fortunately, has bestowed upon me the ability to breathe despite the debris. Visibility is poor, but I can see a gigantic warrior - Malacath - emerging from the dust to speak to me. "Well done. That dishonest deal-maker underestimated you. Clavicus Vile will eventually recover, but he will not soon forget his folly. You have proven yourself worthy, and a rightful champion in my name. Keep the gift I have bestowed upon you, for there is no servant among your kind more deserving, and I will send you on your way." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc7;I wake up in a dark, summertime woodland. The air is hazy and smells of perfume, incense, alcohol and blood. From behind one of the trees steps a being almost like a Dremora, but grander in stature and covered head to toe in armour - no doubt Sanguine himself. "Haha! Nice. Very nice. Hermaeus Mora underestimated you - I'm not surprised - and he lost. Also not surprised about that one. He's a bit too...indolent...for his own good. I'd been terribly bored of late, but you've lightened things up in ways no mortal has been able to. Keep my boon as a token of my esteem and whatnot. I'll be keeping an eye on you." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc8;I wake up in a nightmarish canyon below a dark purple sky. Horrible sights sprout out of nowhere, only to suddenly disappear. Among these appears a masked, robed figure - Vaermina - carrying a staff. "Spectacular work, mortal," she says. "Hermaeus Mora's conceited droning can get dreadfully irritating after a few thousand years. Maybe he'll finally shut up for once. Now I can get back to my favourite hobbies, and not be tied up with this woeful waking mortal nonsense. Keep the gift I granted you. You're amusing, little mortal. I'm sure you'll find a use for it." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc9;I wake up in a green meadow, dotted with emerald hills and glowing in the warmth of midday sun. Nearby I see a strange little man with horns, flanked by a hound, smiling at me. It is Clavicus Vile, with Barbas at his side. "Ah, how lovely!" Clavicus exclaims. "The savage hunter Hircine, outfoxed by his most dangerous game, and the invasion brought to a screeching halt. All in a day's work. Right, hero? You've been one of my finest clients, so I do think you deserve my benefaction. Keep my boon, and I shall send you home. A deal like that, you won't soon see again!" The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc10;I wake up in a fragmented, shadowy plane with a purple, starry sky. Out of one of the shadows steps a hooded figure enveloped by a swirling cloud of dust and filth - Namira. She speaks to me. "Excellent work, mortal. The apex predator Hircine brought to the brink of ruin by the agent of the lowly scavengers. The irony is sweet. Though you are a bit too ostentatious...oh well. Keep my gift. I have no need of it. But do not be arrogant. Remember, before I send you back, that the forgotten and the ignored are the ones who accomplish the most, completely uncontested." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc11;I wake up in a rocky, volcanic wasteland. A violent storm rages in the skies, and amidst the lighting stands a towering, caped warrior brandishing a two-wielded battleaxe - Boethiah - looking down at me. "Superb. Like a bloodthirsty army or a determined band of rebels can topple even the greatest empire, you too have brought down Malacath. He is not as great as he thought. He will not forget this incident. Your martial excellence is astounding for a mortal. Why don't you keep my gift? Most mortals are utterly feckless. You however are more...capable. Go then." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc12;I wake up in a green meadow, dotted with emerald hills and glowing in the warmth of midday sun. Nearby I see a strange little man with horns, flanked by a hound, smiling at me. It is Clavicus Vile, with Barbas at his side. "Ah, how lovely!" Clavicus exclaims. "Malacath is a raucous oaf, with his honour-bound oath and curses. Bah! All that and his invasion brought to a screeching halt. All in a day's work. Right, hero? You've been one of my finest clients, so I do think you deserve my benefaction. Keep my boon, and I shall send you home. A deal like that, you won't soon see again!" The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc13;I wake up in a dark, summertime woodland. The air is hazy and smells of perfume, incense, alcohol and blood. From behind one of the trees steps a being almost like a Dremora, but grander in stature and covered head to toe in armour - no doubt Sanguine himself. "Haha! Nice. Very nice. Mehrunes Dagon underestimated you - I'm not surprised - and he lost. Also not surprised about that one. He's a bit too...aggressive...for his own good. I'd been terribly bored of late, but you've lightened things up in ways no mortal has been able to. Keep my boon as a token of my esteem and whatnot. I'll be keeping an eye on you." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc14;I wake up in a throne room hewn from strange, beautiful stone blocks. Standing up from the throne is a well-dressed, bearded man with rather peculiar eyes - Sheogorath himself. He grins as he furrows his brow. "WONDERFUL! Now that Mehrunes Dagon's power has been reduced by that much more, his influence on your meager mortal plane has gone POOF! Here yesterday, gone hence!

"Well done, mortal," she says. "Mephala is defeated, and weakened to a degree that she will not soon threaten your mortal world. I shall send you back where you belong. Keep my boon. Use it well, to learn the secrets of your world." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc16;I wake up in a sullen, red-skied wasteland. Lava flows here and there, and the smoke billows up into a storming sky. From a rocky outcropping slinks a sickly-looking draconic being - Peryite! - who rears his head down to gaze at me. "Excellent work, mortal," he says. "Mephala's defeat spells the end of her chaotic and insidious machinations...for a time. You fight for the grim reality of order, for which I am grateful. Keep my gift, a useful reward for a useful servant. But you do not belong here, in this plane of Lesser Daedra. I shall send you back from whence you came." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc17;I wake up in a cold, craggy, lifeless landscape. The frigidity is so intense that it almost burns. Emerging from the icy azure plasm is a towering, horned monstrosity - none other than Molag Bal - carrying a huge mace, staring me down with contempt. "How disgraceful. 'The Lady of Infinite Energies' yet brought to her breaking point by a worthless mortal. Meridia will not remember this fondly, and can merely watch as I spread my curse of undeath. That's good, at least. You've amused me, cretin. Keep my boon. Use it to sow hatred and despair in the mortal world. Despite your failings, you still exceed your peers. Somehow." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc18;I wake up in a fragmented, shadowy plane with a purple, starry sky. Out of one of the shadows steps a hooded figure enveloped by a swirling cloud of dust and filth - Namira. She speaks to me. "Excellent work, mortal. Haughty, proud, vain Meridia defeated by the champion of revulsion and decay. The irony is sweet. Though you are a bit too ostentatious...oh well. Keep my gift. I have no need of it. But do not be arrogant. Remember, before I send you back, that the forgotten and the ignored are the ones who accomplish the most, completely uncontested." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc19;I wake up in a rocky, volcanic wasteland. A violent storm rages in the skies, and amidst the lighting stands a towering, caped warrior brandishing a two-wielded battleaxe - Boethiah - looking down at me. "Superb. Like a bloodthirsty army or a determined band of rebels can topple even the greatest empire, you too have brought down Molag Bal. I wonder how he feels to be dominated so by a mortal. A refreshing reversal of his expectations. Your martial excellence is astounding for a mortal. Why don't you keep my gift? Most mortals are utterly feckless. You however are more...capable. Go then." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc20;I wake up on a rocky island in a luminous, iridescent sky. In the centre of the island is a being of pure energy - Meridia! - in the form of a woman. Frowning, she speaks tersely. "Molag Bal is defeated, his armies shattered, and his pride crumbling. His corrupting influence will be stuck in Coldharbor for some time. He will strike again, of this there is no doubt, but victory is mine, and I will not be denied. For your part, keep the gift I have bestowed upon you. Use it to cleanse your world of its impurities, and guard your world against corruption. I bid you farewell, mortal." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc21;I wake up in a conifer forest in the dead of night. The dark sky and thick foliage restricts most visibility, but in the shadows, I notice a tall humanoid being with the head of a stag - Hircine! - wielding a spear. Hircine steps forward and speaks. "Well met, mighty hunter. And well done. Your cunning, alacrity and strength are beyond mortal compare - and rightfully so, to topple Namira. Eventually her hunger will draw her back out of the shadows to scavenge upon the mortal realm once more. But that will not be for some time. I shall send you back to your world. And keep my gift. It will be a worthy complement to your arsenal." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc22;I wake up on a rocky island in a luminous, iridescent sky. In the centre of the island is a being of pure energy - Meridia! - in the form of a woman. Frowning, she speaks tersely. "Namira is defeated, her armies shattered, and pushed back into obscurity. She will fester in the Scuttling Void, and she will eventually reemerge, of this there is no doubt, but victory is mine, and I will not be denied. For your part, keep the gift I have bestowed upon you. Use it to cleanse your world of its impurities, and guard your world against corruption. I bid you farewell, mortal." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc23;I wake up in a palace of roses, complemented by a landscape that is picturesque beyond description. A robed woman, radiating with energy, stands in front of me. It is Azura! She speaks to me. "And as I had foreseen, the insidious Nocturnal has been vanquished and retreated back into the darkness. She will not threaten the mortal world anytime soon. With my guidance, you have triumphed, mortal. And so I grant to you my boon, that you may bring enlightment and just rule - as I envision - upon your world. I shall send you back to where you belong. Farewell, mortal." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc24;I wake up in a grim, misty, cavernous place. The sky is a sickly grey - in fact, so is nearly everything else. In the midst of all this stands a female figure, many-armed and draped in bleached white skulls. It is Mephala, who stares at me, smiling. "What delightful discord you sow upon not only the mortal world, but Oblivion itself! Nocturnal carries such confidence, such certainty, only to have it all unraveled by a mere mortal! I am most pleased by your deeds. Your potential is exceptional, and it should be nurtured. Keep the gift given to you, and begone. And remember, that plucking but the tiniest thread can bring even the richest tapestry to ruin." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc25;I wake up in a grim, misty, cavernous place. The sky is a sickly grey - in fact, so is nearly everything else. In the midst of all this stands a female figure, many-armed and draped in bleached white skulls. It is Mephala, who stares at me, smiling. "What delightful discord you sow upon not only the mortal world, but Oblivion itself! Peryite deigns to enforce his precious order, only to have it all unraveled by a mere mortal! I am most pleased by your deeds. Your potential is exceptional, and it should be nurtured. Keep the gift given to you, and begone. And remember, that plucking but the tiniest thread can bring even the richest tapestry to ruin." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc26;I wake up in a nightmarish canyon below a dark purple sky. Horrible sights sprout out of nowhere, only to suddenly disappear. Among these appears a masked, robed figure - Vaermina - carrying a staff. "Spectacular work, mortal," she says. "Peryite is truly defeated, and the lower planes of Oblivion will be rife with chaos. More importantly, he no longer interferes with my interests with all the doom and destruction. Now I can get back to my favourite hobbies, and not be tied up with this woeful waking mortal nonsense. Keep the gift I granted you. You're amusing, little mortal. I'm sure you'll find a use for it." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc27;I wake up on a stone walkway surrounded by a roiling sea of sickly-green ooze that stretches to the horizon in every direction. The sky is likewise green. Above me is a great, writhing mass of black ink, eyes and tentacles, the form of Hermaeus Mora. All the eyes gaze at me. "You have matched by expectations and accomplished what I knew you would. With this, neither Sanguine's merrymaking nor his invasion will interfere with the scholarly pursuits of my mortal pawns. Excellent. As the champion of Hermaeus Mora, you have the honour of keeping the artifact granted to you. Know that you are worthy of my attention. We will speak again, whether you wish to or not." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc28;I wake up in a desolate land of lava flows. The air is frigid and choked with sulfur, while the ground beneath is almost too hot to tolerate. In front of me is the massive, four-armed Mehrunes Dagon, who looks down at me, eyes ablaze. "Most impressive, mortal. Your ambition has catapulted you into legend - a champion great enough to stand against Sanguine and not only defeat him, but send him cowering into the ether. A lowly mortal you may be, you are mighty all the same. Even I, Mehrunes Dagon, recognise that. I would let you keep my boon. Let your desires, compulsions and goals drive you to success. And destroy all who stand against you!" The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc29;I wake up in a palace of roses, complemented by a landscape that is picturesque beyond description. A robed woman, radiating with energy, stands in front of me. It is Azura! She speaks to me. "And as I had foreseen, the maniacal Sheogorath has been cast back to the Shivering Isles, and the influence of madness will be stemmed. He will not threaten the mortal world anytime soon. With my guidance, you have triumphed, mortal. And so I grant to you my boon, that you may bring enlightment and just rule - as I envision - upon your world. I shall send you back to where you belong. Farewell, mortal." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc30;I wake up in a desolate land of lava flows. The air is frigid and choked with sulfur, while the ground beneath is almost too hot to tolerate. In front of me is the massive, four-armed Mehrunes Dagon, who looks down at me, eyes ablaze. "Most impressive, mortal. Your ambition has catapulted you into legend - a champion great enough to stand against Sheogorath and not only defeat him, though he lacks the sense to understand his ruin. A lowly mortal you may be, you are mighty all the same. Even I, Mehrunes Dagon, recognise that. I would let you keep my boon. Let your desires, compulsions and goals drive you to success. And destroy all who stand against you!" The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc31;I wake up on a stone walkway surrounded by a roiling sea of sickly-green ooze that stretches to the horizon in every direction. The sky is likewise green. Above me is a great, writhing mass of black ink, eyes and tentacles, the form of Hermaeus Mora. All the eyes gaze at me. "You have matched by expectations and accomplished what I knew you would. With this, neither Vaermina's nightmares nor her invasion will interfere with the scholarly pursuits of my mortal pawns. Excellent. As the champion of Hermaeus Mora, you have the honour of keeping the artifact granted to you. Know that you are worthy of my attention. We will speak again, whether you wish to or not." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115Desc32;I wake up in a sullen, red-skied wasteland. Lava flows here and there, and the smoke billows up into a storming sky. From a rocky outcropping slinks a sickly-looking draconic being - Peryite! - who rears his head down to gaze at me. "Excellent work, mortal," he says. "Vaermina's defeat spells the end of her disruptive nightmares and her army, as well. You fight for the grim reality of order, for which I am grateful. Keep my gift, a useful reward for a useful servant. But you do not belong here, in this plane of Lesser Daedra. I shall send you back from whence you came." The next moment, I find myself back home.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion115OptA;I hope this worked.;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapInvasion115OptC;I will champion [offmap_invasion_patron.GetFirstName]...secretly.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion120;The world has been restored to normal. The Daedric armies that plagued the realms of Nirn all disappeared as suddenly as they manifested. The destruction that they caused may take years, possibly centuries, to be undone, but it will be some time before a Daedric Prince threatens the mortal plane again.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapInvasion120Accept;The world is safe...for now.;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapStatus50Title;[FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s Power Waxing;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus50A;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has regained some of [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] strength and has put the crisis that threatened [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm behind [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHim]. It is only a matter of time before the status quo is restored.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus50B;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has fully regained [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] strength and has restored [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm to normal. It is possible that [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] will grow yet more powerful, but only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus50C;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] revels in nearly unprecedented power and has the ability to have a profound effect on the mortal plane if [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSheHe] so pleases. Cultists and worshipers are scrambling to find ways to get in [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s good graces.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus50Accept;Intriguing...;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus52Title;[FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s Power Waning;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus52A;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has been weakened somewhat, though what exactly caused this to transpire is unclear. It is also unclear if this represents a trend. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] could recover at any moment, though there is the possibility that [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] power will decline yet further.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus52B;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] is weakened and off-balance, and [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm is in a tenuous position. Most likely, [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] will recover and restore the status quo relatively soon, but no one knows when this will occur.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus52C;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s realm has been thrown into disarray, the Lesser Daedra of [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm struggling to make sense of a chaotic and dangerous situation. Mortal travelers who have visited are warning others to stay within the bounds of Mundus, lest they become collateral damage in [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm's ongoing internal strife.;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapStatus54A;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] is taking a keen interest in mortal affairs as of late. Offerings sent to [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm have been reciprocated with powerful boons including Daedric warriors and military equipment. Virtually everyone interested in speaking with [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has been scrambling to receive gifts from beyond the liminal barriers.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus54B;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has taken an extremely proactive approach in dealing with the inhabitants of Nirn. The barriers between Mundus and Oblivion have done little to stem [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName]'s interactions with mortals, and even large numbers of Daedric warriors can be summoned from [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm and into the mortal plane with surprisingly little effort.;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapStatus56A;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has lost some interest in the mortal world as of late. Dealings between [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] and mortal "clients" have been declining, not out of the interest of the latter, but a lack of strong communication from the former. Some believe that [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has plans to withdraw entirely into [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;x
EKOffmapStatus56B;Mages and scholars across the known world are in agreement - [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] is utterly disinterested in mortal affairs. Possibly it is because of some internal strife in [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm, or out of a temperamental distaste towards mortals. No one is certain, and all but the most token attempts to reach out to [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] and [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] subjects within [FromFrom.Ruler.GetHerHis] realm have either been rejected or completely ignored.;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapStatus200;[FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has made an official proclamation outlining intentions to ready the Almsivi faithful for war. This may be in an effort to reclaim lost land, liberate followers of the Temple who are ruled by heathens, or to destroy profane elements within Almsivi-worshiping lands. Ordinators, Buoyant Armigers and other holy warriors stand at the ready to serve any and all Almsivi rulers who require their services.;;;;;;;;;x

EKOffmapStatus203;[FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] has withdrawn into their inner sanctum, visited only by personal attendants and guards, and the highest-ranking members of the Temple hierarchy. Diplomats and pilgrims are turned away, with the most frequent explanation being that [FromFrom.Ruler.GetFirstName] "has important matters to attend to."
