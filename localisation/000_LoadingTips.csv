LOADING_TIP_33;Nibenay is the eastern half of Cyrodiil and Colovia is the western half.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_34;The Falmer have already been twisted by their own corrupt natures and the Dwemer imprisonment. They will not appear in-game to play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_35;The Imperial culture is both a modern fusion of Nibenean and Colovian cultures and the proto-culture from which the two originally diverged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LOADING_TIP_53;In some of Tamriel's darkest recesses, where the living fear to tread, the bones of the dead still walk. These skeletons feel no pain or remorse and deserve no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_54;Windhelm is the oldest city in Skyrim and may be the oldest human city on the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_55;Whilst under-aged or under a regency as an adult, you will have a hard time finding valid CBs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_56;Religious CBs cannot be used by everyone - they can only be used on or by a fringe religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_57;Being the Mane inhibits you from using some CBs, especially if you are not a powerful Mane;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_58;Almsivi followers have a hard time going to war against the Tribunal Temple, just as the Temple does against other followers of Almsivi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_59;Beware the Tribunal Temple! Attacking them will draw the ire of Vivec, who will conjure hordes of Daedra to destroy your armies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_60;Tang Mo who worship the Thousand Monkeys are pacifists. They have trouble waging offensive wars, but are rewarded with extra favour for remaining at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LOADING_TIP_69;Stendarr is the god of righteous rule by might and merciful forbearance. He is the patron of the Imperial Legion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_70;Talos is the hero-god of mankind. Once the mortal emperor Tiber Septim, his inclusion amongst the Aedra was officially denied in the Fourth Era, but that hasn't stopped the Nords of Skyrim from revering him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_71;Zenithar is the god of work and commerce. Also known as the patron of merchants and middle nobility, his priests strive to bring peace and prosperity through hard work and honest profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LOADING_TIP_136;M'aiq thinks that the Elves look much more exotic than before. He does not see what the fuss is about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LOADING_TIP_144;M'aiq does not understand what is so impressive about shouting. M'aiq can shout whenever he wants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_145;M'aiq knows that smarter people know more spells. M'aiq used to know what happened when you hit your head, but then he forgot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_146;M'aiq thinks that having a place to record all one's problems would be most useful. Just complaining about them is no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_147;Wood Elves aren't made of wood. Sea Elves aren't made of water. M'aiq still wonders about High Elves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_148;Stop right there, potential crusader king! Submit to the mod and serve your loading time. Your spare evening is now forfeit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_149;There are many guilds in Tamriel, some of which interact with Yokuda and Pyandonea. There are four guilds in Akavir. Atmora has no guilds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_150;Dragonborn characters are far more talented at learning the Thu'um than non-Dragonborn characters. Those with the Dragonblood also have some skill with learning the Thu'um.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
