book_pocket_guide_1_desc;Author: [event_target:pg1_author.GetDynName], on behalf of the Imperial Geographical Society\The Pocket Guide to the Empire was an attempt to popularise and update the older, and by then heavily outdated Improved Emperor's Guide to Tamriel. The texts are shorter than the predecessor manuals but the Guide accomplished its task, being widely distributed by the IGS across Tamriel and helping bring together the various peoples of Tamriel. Critics commenting on the Guide however claim it is little more than a piece of biased propaganda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
book_pocket_guide_2_desc;Author: [event_target:pg2_author.GetDynName], on behalf of the Imperial Geographical Society\nThe 2nd Edition of the popular Pocket Guide.

The 2nd Edition attempted to provide more information than the 1st Edition but according to critics it was still heavily biased toward the author's favoured peoples, depicting those of other cultures to be more primitive and backwards than the author's own. The so-called "Pocket" Guide 2nd Edition was also too large to comfortably fit a normal sized person's pockets...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Much of the bias of the older Guides was replaced with a more optimistic view of the various cultures of Tamriel in a fairer manner. Some biases were of course still present, but critics viewed them more as the innocence and naivety of the author than intentional derogation of "lesser" peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

book_pocket_guide_5_desc;Author: [event_target:pg5_author.GetDynName], on behalf of the Imperial Geographical Society\nThe 5th Edition of the famous Pocket Guide is considered to be the most complete and unbiased edition of the Guide to date.

masque_of_clavicus_vile_desc;Much like its namesake and creator, the Masque of Clavicus Vile is steeped in both charisma and treachery. Originally granted to a disfigured noblewoman who sought affection and respect, the Masque gained its first wearer great esteem until its sudden disappearance, setting in motion her abrupt banishment and her daughter's bloody campaign of vengeance. Those who wear the Masque are rarely discouraged by this story, however - widespread respect is a boon that can pay dividends for a lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

weapon_umbra_desc;The Umbra Sword was a Daedric artifact designed with the sole purpose of the entrapment of souls. The ancient witch Naenra Waerr created the sword at the request of Clavicus Vile, who wanted the sword as a tool of mischief which would send him souls from the mortal realm. Naenra created the sword, but it was unstable. Vile gave the witch a piece of his power to be imbued in the sword, which stabilised the weapon. However, Naenra supposedly tricked him, as the piece of Vile's power imbued in the sword became a sentient being which called itself Umbra. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she hid the sword. The sword took on a life of its own, remaining hidden until a worthy wielder was found. Umbra would then slowly take control of the wielder. The Umbra Sword had the ability to change shape, but it was always in the form of a bladed weapon. It has been reported as a black and silver claymore, a jet black longsword and as a black sword emblazoned with red markings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
