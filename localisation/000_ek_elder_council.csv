elder_council_desc;Founded either by the Remans or during the days of the Alessian Empire, the Elder Council served as the administrative body of the great empires of humanity. Comprising some of the most capable, influential, and wealthy individuals in Tamriel, the Council is the tool that allows for the imperial will to be carried out. It does have a will of its own, however, and many Emperors have found themselves fighting the Council more than they fight hostile nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ecsway.62.accept;[From.GetSheHe]'ll be back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.63.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nI wholly agree that the Ruby Throne and Elder Council must work together to let the Empire prosper. Marrying [swayer_potential_bride.GetTitledFirstName] and [swayee_potential_bride.GetFirstName] would help cement this union of powers.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.63.accept;Your proposal seems reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.63.refuse;My relatives are not bargaining chips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.64.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\n[swayer_potential_bride.GetFirst] and [swayee_potential_bride.GetFirstName] shall form an opportune union. Your continued loyalty to the Ruby Throne is appreciated.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.64.accept;I love weddings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.65.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nIt is the opinion of the Ruby Throne that a match between [swayee_potential_bride.GetFirstName] and [swayer_potential_bride.GetFirstName] is not in the interest of the Empire.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.65.accept;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.66.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nYour concern for the well-being of the realm is commendable. I'm sure that you will agree that one of the first steps to bettering the Empire is to ensure that the [target_ec_desired_title.GetFullName] has a local administrator.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.66.accept;[From.GetFirstName] would make an excellent governor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
desired_title_will_be_created;The §Y[target_ec_desired_title.GetFullName]§! will be created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.66.refuse;Imperial land is not for sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.66.bankrupt;I cannot afford to create such a title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.67;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nYour arguments are convincing. We hereby grant the [target_ec_desired_title.GetFullName] to you with all associated titles, rights, and appelations. The Ruby Throne expects great results.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.67.accept;The [From.GetElderCouncilRank] is wise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.68;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nWhile your concern is appreciated, the agents of the imperial court are perfectly capable of administrating [target_ec_desired_title.GetName].\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.68.accept;I'll get that title somehow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.69.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nI wholeheartedly agree, the needs of the realm must be attended to. However, without my own estates to manage, I find it difficult to raise the resources needed to make any meaningful changes. Perhaps I can prove myself by governing [target_ec_desired_title.GetName].\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.69.accept;[From.GetFirstName] will have [From.GetHerHis] land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.69.refuse;Imperial land is not for sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.70.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nWe hereby grant you the [target_ec_desired_title.GetFullName]. May it provide you with all that you need to help support the Ruby Throne and the Empire.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.70.accept;Estates of my very own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.71.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nThe [target_ec_desired_title.GetFullName] is unfortunately a vital organ of the Ruby Throne's holdings. Delegating its management would not be in the Empire's interests at this time.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.71.accept;My time will come eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.72.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nBefore I can commit my full attention to the Empire's well-being, I must first ensure that my own realm is being properly managed. Allowing me direct control over the [target_ec_desired_title.GetFullName] would be duly appreciated.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.72.accept;[target_ec_desired_title.GetName] is rightfully [From.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.72.refuse;Imperial land is not for sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.73.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nYour request is just. The [target_ec_desired_title.GetFullName] is yours to oversee.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.73.accept;The integrity of the realm is restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ecsway.74.desc;To [Root.GetElderCouncilFirstName],\nUnfortunately, the demands of the realm prevent us from granting you the [target_ec_desired_title.GetFullName] at this time. Your enduring patience is appreciated.\n\nSigned, [From.GetElderCouncilFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
