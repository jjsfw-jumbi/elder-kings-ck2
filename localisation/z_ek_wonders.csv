ekwonder.5.d;As the owner of Skyforge, you have access to the best blacksmiths and materials one could hope to find in Skyrim. They are ready to assist you in the forging of the finest blades and armors any proud Nord could hope to get.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.5.optA;I need a strong weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekwonder.5.optD;I changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.6.d;A powerful weapon, forged from the finest steel, has always been and still is a Nord best friend. Blades, maces, axes, daggers, bows, this forge has crafted them all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.6.optA;I need a sword by my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
skyforge_forge_sword_ct;You will attempt to forge a §YNordic Sword§!. Sword tend to give a higher §YMartial§! than other weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.6.optB;An axe is what I need.;;;;;;;;;; ;;;x

ekwonder.7.d;Any fool can wield a weapon. But being able to swiftly move in an armor, evading or absorbing what would otherwise be fatal blows, that is an art not many people can claim to master. And of course, the quality of the armor plays a very important role in a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekwonder.8.d;Nords, and their Skaal or Atmoran brethren, have always had a strong tradition around jewelry. It has been used for millenia to represent deities and spirits, and honors our glorious past so we never forget where we come from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.8.optA;I will carefully craft a Nord Amulet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.8.optB;I will carefully craft a Skaal Amulet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.9.d;One of the most important parts of forging is choosing the right materials for the job. Skyrim is known to have several rich mines, with some of the finest steel of all Tamriel. Whiterun has several mines nearby, with lower quality but cheaper ore. Alternatively, we could also use whatever scraps are left around the forge, though it will hurt the final result quality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The magical blessings would certainly raise the quality of our craft...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.12.optA;Very well, do your magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.12.optB;We do not need your magic, mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.12.optC;I can do it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.13.d;Disaster! The Skyforge itself has been damaged. While it shouldn't hinder our current efforts, once we are done the Skyforge will need to be taken care of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.13.optA;What, five years?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.14.d;Even the most skilled blacksmith cannot always solely rely on his imagination or memory to craft high quality equipment. We and our assistants may have overestimated our capacities, and we will need to either get someone from outside the province to help, or lower our expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.14.optA;Get someone from Akavir if needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.14.optB;Let's lower our expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.14.optC;Surely someone from the Guild could help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
is_part_warrior_guild_tooltip_info;This option is available because you are part of a §YMartial-based society§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.19.d;It is done. The artifact you spent so much time and resources on has been crafted. Its quality depends on how much resources have been spent on it, and how you acted during its crafting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.19.optA;It's a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
skyforge_no_artifact_ct;Unfortunately, the artifact would be of so low quality that it wouldn't be usable... It had to be thrown away, for your own safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.19.optB;It's nothing fancy, but it will do its job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.19.optC;A very fine craft. We can be proud of our work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.19.optD;It's almost perfect...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This one managed to smuggle in Cyrodiil as a child, after being left to survive in the streets of Alinor for years. Here, [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] was taken under the wing of another Altmer, who taught [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHim] how to fight, with both sword and magic.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As dusk settled, only one remained.\n\n[gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] is a loyal servant of the House of Troubles. While some of the Great Houses of Morrowind, specially the Telvanni, may tolerate members that deal with the Bad Daedra, none will take one that openly and fervently worships them. Once outed as a member of the [gladiator_recruited.Religion.GetName], [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] was banned from [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] House and decided to move to Cyrodiil. Following the guidance of [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] unholy master, [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] found a new way to be of service: spreading his message through blood and cheer in the Arena.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As dusk settled, only one remained.\n\nA fearsome pirate, [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] evaded the Imperial Fleet for years, until one fatal day where [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] fleet was ambushed and attacked. Most of the crew died, but [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] made a deal with the fleet captain. For every match [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] wins, the former captain gets richer, and [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] lives another day.

As dusk settled, only one remained.\n\nA small Mer, [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] was found barely alive by a Khajiit caravan near an Imga ritual site in the border between Valenwood and Cyrodiil. Taken to the Imperial City for treatment, [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] woke up amnesic and blind, forever resentful of [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] mysterious primate attackers yet unable to remember [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] own origins. Initially, [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] trained marksmanship as a form of therapy, developing [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] other senses while also establishing a connection with [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] Bosmeri heritage. Eventually, however, [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] realized that a blinded, yet surprisingly skilled, archer could make some easy money in the Arena.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.150.d.nordBerserker;As dawn broke, dozens of warriors were standing in the Arena. As dusk settled, only one remained.\n\n[gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName], a scarred warrior hailing from the frozen lands of Skyrim, came to Cyrodiil after defeating every Champion and most beasts from the northern province. Pack of wolves, bandits, giants, old undead and untold legends, none could match [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] skills and rage. Only the cursed blade of an old Reachman legend found its way near [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHim], and left a visible mark on [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHim] face... But when Skyrim could not bring any new challenge, the Imperial Arena called. And for now, nothing and no one has been able to best [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHim].\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.150.d.genericHeretic;As dawn broke, dozens of warriors were standing in the Arena. As dusk settled, only one remained.\n\nYou remember [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName]'s name. A known heretic, allegedly corrupted by [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] recently asked a local preacher for a conversion to our faith. Decided to test [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] new-found religious righteous, the local clergy sentenced [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName], with little to no opposition from [Root.RelHead.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick], to a controversial gladiatorial penitence. They rationalized that as [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] had previously claimed that [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] was a "champion" of [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] old faith, [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] would prove [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] repentance by becoming a new type of champion: an Arena champion, elevated to grace by the blessing of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. It seems that [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] has fulfilled his test.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Having joined the guild at an early age, [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] whole personality revolves around [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] involvement with the organization. Unsurprisingly, when [gladiator_recruited.Society.GetTitledGrandMasterName] asked a volunteer to represent the prowess of the guild in the Arena, [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] was the first to respond, insisting that [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] and [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] alone should have the honor. Luckily to [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHim], the abilities learned in [gladiator_recruited.Society.GetName] were extremely useful in the fast-paced battlegrounds of the Arena.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekwonder.150.d.genericCriminal;As dawn broke, dozens of warriors were standing in the Arena. As dusk settled, only one remained.\n\nYour advisors know little of [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName]'s past. Looking like a common prisoner from the local prison, fighting in the Arena just as any other prisoner might do, [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] looks inconspicuous. Even though [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] was convicted for the small crime of lollygagging, which didn't demand any gladiatorial penance, [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] insisted on it. Based on [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] ruthlessness, some rumor that [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] past must involve an obscure connection to some kind of crime syndicate. Whatever [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] has done in the past, truth is that [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] win at the Arena was a true lesson in furtive tactics, backstabbing and outsmarting your opponents. [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName]'s past life may be mysterious, but [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] combat abilities are now widely known.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As the daughter of a traditional Orsimer chief, she learned from a young age that, under the Code of Malacath, it was expected that she would grow to marry, and serve, an allied chief as his Forge-Wife or Hunt-Wife, securing her father's stronghold an important alliance against outsiders. Unfortunately for the Orcish patriarchy, [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] fled the stronghold under the guise of the night, leaving all those expectations behind her. Disowned by her family, she preferred to be poor and free than to be a Whatever-Wife to an old Orc she didn't even love.

As the son of a traditional Orsimer chief, he learned from a young age that, under the Code of Malacath, he eventually would have to challenge his brothers, and his own father, for the right to rule their lands. Unfortunately for the Orcish patriarchy, [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] couldn't bring himself to such fate and fled the stronghold under the guise of the night, leaving all those expectations behind him. Disowned by his family, he preferred to be poor and free than to be forced to partake in ancient traditions that he didn't even fully comprehend.

It only so happens that the quickest way to do so was joining the Arena. It seems that [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName]'s years of contemplative mediation have allowed [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHim] to fully control [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] muscles and deliver a superb hook punch. Truthfully, [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] display of hand-to-hand combat has left you and all the Arena baffled. Even if [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] would eventually need to return to [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] cloister, right now [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] has allowed [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis]self to rejoice this blissful moment.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

[gladiator_recruited.GetHerHisCap] series of rapid yet precises slashes made it seem like a small tornado had taken place in the gladiatorial pit. You're informed that this mysterious champion has just arrived in town the other day. Arriving by the local port, [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] came in a merchant ship that sailed from Herne in The Chain, through Stros M'Akai, all the way here to negotiate a trading deal with a local merchant. Some rather inventive Arena-goers even claim that [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] apparent lack of a tongue, as well as [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] self-imposed exile, are a known traditional Yokudan punishment for the crime of sharing secret sword techniques with the common folk. It's undetermined if there is any truth to those rumors, as [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] never speaks of it. Your only certainty is that the supernatural display of swordsmanship accomplished by [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] in the Arena have an eerily similarity to the deeds attributed to the original Yokudan's Swordsingers.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Years ago, [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] arrived in Skyrim, and went to study with the Greybeards. [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] seemed to have a natural talent with the Voice, but was expelled from the order soon after.

Shortly before [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] left [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] homeland, the Tsaesci attacked and razed [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] small village, only leaving a handful of scattered and scared villagers. They fled their land, joining another ship of survivors who tried their luck in Cathnoquey, and some even decided to join the mythic "Dragonguard". [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] did not find the legendary Akaviri warriors, but found [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] calling in the Imperial Arena.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As dusk settled, only one remained.\n\nThis exile from the islands of the Quey was banished for sacrificing many Chimer to the so-called "Plaguing Kings". After further inquiry into these dieties, it appears that they are the local version of the Daedric Princes of Madness, Destruction, Curses, and Domination. Now that a fragile peace has been found between the Chimer and the Quey, these Gods are not revered anymore... Or at least, not as much as they could be.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Lucky to [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName], [gladiator_recruited.GetHerHis] adoptive team was never short of fellow Redguards fleeing political persecution in Hammerfell, so [gladiator_recruited.GetSheHe] had the chance of learning traditional [gladiator_recruited.Culture.GetName] sword techniques since infancy. All that training paid off and [gladiator_recruited.GetFirstName] eventually became rather renowned, breaking some records as one of the Arena's longest-serving champions, never losing a fight that didn't involve some magical shenanigan.\n[gladiator_recruited.GetSheHeCap] now stands ready, eager to join you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
