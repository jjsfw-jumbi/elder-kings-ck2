vamp_c_attack;You suddenly wake up in the middle of the night, and feel as if something is wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp1;What could it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_dead;A vampire is biting your neck! You struggle, but it's in vain. The vampire leaves and you lie on your bed, bleeding out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp2;I knew I should have hired more guards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_bitten;You feel light-headed, and your neck feels sore. When you touch it, you feel two small bumps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp3;I'm sure it's nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp3;I should go see a healer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_ran;You notice someone sneaking towards your bed. The stranger notices you are awake, and panics, sprinting out of the room to safety. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp4;Guards! I need more guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_guards;You hear a commotion outside, and go out to investigate. One of your guards informs you that an intruder was found, and was killed while attempting to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp5;Who would try to infiltrate my home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_turned1;You dream of someone sleeping peacefully in his bed, when a shadowy, gaunt figure silently enters the room. Approaching the bed, the figure leans down and sinks its fangs into the sleeping person. After a few moments, the pale figure rises, blood dripping down [Root.GetHerHim] chin. As colour flows back into the vampire's face, and [Root.GetHerHim] features fill out, you recognize the face as your own. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp6;You awake screaming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_turned2;After a moment, you realise with relief that it was just a dream. You go to draw back the curtains, but as the sunlight touches your hand, it burns your skin black. You recoil, and scream once more. Frightened, you lift your hands to your face, finding your teeth have extended, and your face has grown thinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp7;What have I become? I am a monster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_visit1;A mysterious stranger appears at court, asking if he could stay awhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp8;Sure, why not? You can stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp8;Of course not! Get out of my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_visit2;You and your new courtier became fast friends. So much so, that after a few months, he confides with you a great secret. As it turns out, your new friend is actually a vampire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp9;Amazing. Maybe you should share your gift with your closest friend, hmm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp9;What?!? A vampire?!? Guards, arrest this foul creature at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCvamp9;This saddens me greatly. I cannot allow you stay here. Leave my realm at once, and never return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_battle;The vampire den in your capital still persists, despite the efforts of you guardsmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp10;I will lead the hunt myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp10;I will lead the hunt myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCvamp10;I shall destroy them with my magick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDvamp10;Sounds dangerous, someone else should deal with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_infected_battle;After scouring your capital of vampires, you feel more fatigued than usual. Could you be ill?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp11;I'm sure it's nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp11;I should go see a healer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_power;As a vampire, your powers increase as you age, and you become both stronger, and more adept at magick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp12;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_suspicious_guards;The guards have noticed an unusual amount of murders recently. Maybe you should be more careful with your feeding habits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp13;Frame someone else for the murders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp13;Reveal yourself as a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCvamp13;Hope they don't find you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_caught_guards;The guards have discovered you on the street during the course of their investigation into the murders. The blood on your hands is still fresh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp14;I will fight them off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp14;I will fight them off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCvamp14;I shall destroy them with my magick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDvamp14;"Stand down immediately, I command you as your ruler!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEvamp14;Well, I suppose I am off to prison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFvamp14;Maybe if I run fast enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_found_feeding;As you feed on a beggar in an alley, a man notices. His eyes widen, and he starts running. You are almost certain he saw your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp15;Let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp15;Run them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCvamp15;Destroy them with your magick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_c_age;There are whispers around court of your apparent lack of ageing. One man claims he last saw you twenty five years ago, yet you don't seem to have aged a day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp16;Reveal yourself as a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp16;Ignore the rumours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCvamp16;Claim your magick is keeping your body young and healthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
remove_strange_vamp;As a vampire, it is already implied that you are "strange".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp17;So why both?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cure_disease_vamp;Vampires, being undead, are immune to all diseases, as well as age-related weaknesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp18;So stop being sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_infect_wife;You are getting older, as is your spouse, but only [From.GetSheHe] is feeling the toll of the years. Why live forever if you can't be with family?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp19;Would [From.GetFirstName] really want to be a vampire though?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp19;[From.GetSheHe] should join me in eternal life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_infect_child;You are getting older, as is your child, but only [From.GetSheHe] is feeling the toll of the years. Why live forever if you can't be with family?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp20;Would [From.GetFirstName] really want to be a vampire though?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp20;[From.GetSheHe] should join me in eternal life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_infect_courtier;You are considering granting one of your courtiers the dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp21;[From.GetSheHe] might not make a good vampire though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp21;My realm shall be bolstered by more vampires!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_infect_vassal;You are considering granting one of your vassals the dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp22;[From.GetSheHe] might not make a good vampire though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp22;My realm shall be bolstered by more vampires!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vamp_c_infect_lover;As time goes by, you think of what eternity would be like without your lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp23;But would [From.GetFirstName] really want to be a vampire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBvamp23;The thought is unbearable! [From.GetSheHe] must join me in eternal life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spouse_died_vamp;Your spouse died when you tried to turn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp24;NOOOOOOO!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
child_died_vamp;Your child died when you tried to turn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp25;NOOOOOOO!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
courtier_died_vamp;Your courtier died when you tried to turn [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp26;A tragedy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vassal_died_vamp;Your vassal died when you tried to turn [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp27;Such a shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lover_died_vamp;Your lover died when you tried to turn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvamp28;NOOOOOOO!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
