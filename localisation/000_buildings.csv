ruins_bosmeri_0;Bosmeri Ruins - Unexplored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_bosmeri_0_desc;Dense foliage almost completely conceals a dead, desiccated graht-oak - a telltale remnant of a lost Bosmeri settlement. Ferocious predators, perhaps drawn by the lingering magicks of long-dead Greenspeakers, have made their homes in the hollowed-out tree, limiting treasure hunters to the outskirts of the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_bosmeri_1;Bosmeri Ruins - Basic Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_bosmeri_1_desc;Government bounties on the local predators have encouraged intrepid hunters to eliminate some of the hostile wildlife, in turn permitting a small archaeological team to recover and study valuables from some of the outer parts of the towering graht-oak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_bosmeri_2;Bosmeri Ruins - Moderate Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ruins_velothi_0_desc;An imposing Velothi stronghold, monolithic in its construction, sits ominously quiet amidst dead trees and Emperor Parasols. A renegade wizard, guarded by a handful of thugs and Daedra, studies in total seclusion, occasionally producing enchanted trinkets that find their way to local markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_velothi_1;Velothi Ruins - Basic Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_velothi_1_desc;A government-funded force, contracted to take over the ruined site, is currently skirmishing with the wizard's retinue - and winning, bringing back Daedra hearts and Daedra skin as well as weapons, armor and gold as proof of their victories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_velothi_2;Velothi Ruins - Moderate Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_velothi_2_desc;The siege on the Velothi structure is nearly over, with the wizard and all remaining followers retreating to the central chamber of the complex.

ruins_orsimer_1;Orsimer Ruins - Basic Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_orsimer_1_desc;Excavators and their armed protectors have been sent to the stronghold with the intention of studying it. As goblin sentries have been felled and their belongings recovered, the archaeologists have been able to study some of the Orcish architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_orsimer_2;Orsimer Ruins - Moderate Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_orsimer_2_desc;A siege has commenced on the stronghold's longhouse, which is believed to house the goblin chief and the resident tribe's shaman. Further studies of the outlying stronghold are turning up impressive samples of Orcish weapons and armor, and examination of the forge is shedding some light on traditional Orc forging techniques.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_orsimer_3;Orsimer Ruins - Advanced Excavations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ruins_orsimer_3_desc;The archaeologist's armed escort group has broken into the longhouse and slain the chieftain and shaman.
