And so it was, the city was consecrated as the holiest necropolis of Morrowind. Because of this, common men are forbidden to be buried on its sacred ground.

Sie mochte den Ort so sehr, dass sie ihren Sohn bat, diesen zu ihrem persönlichen Garten zu machen. So kam es, dass Berg und Halbinsel gesegnet und zum Garten der Mutter Gottes wurden. Allen Frauen ist das betreten der gesegneten Erde streng verboten. Die Mönche aber leben nun seit Jahrhunderten dort und im Laufe der Jahre mehrt sich die Anzahl der Klöster.;;¡Mi Señor, hemos recibido una invitación para visitar los monasterios sagrados del monte Athos! Los monjes son muy protectores con sus dominios y dicha invitación es sin duda testimonio de vuestra eminente posición entre los hombres.\n\nSe dice que el estado del monte Athos como lugar sagrado comenzó cuando fue visitado por primera vez por la Virgen María, a quien le gustó tanto que pidió a su Hijo que lo convirtiera en su jardín privado. Y así fue, la montaña y la península fueron consagrados como el Jardín de la Madre de Dios. Por este motivo, las mujeres tienen prohibido pisar en su suelo sagrado.

Many of them refuse to accept that a lowborn woman from [From.GetName], however competent and pious, be continuously given so many privileges normally reserved for nobility. It sets a bad example for the peasants and may cause unrest, they fear.

The judges come mostly from the clergy, and they begin a hard line of questioning against the young woman. There is unrest outside the castle where the trial is held, as many followers have come to pray for her and express their belief in her innocence. This trial seems set to last for a while.;[From.GetFirstName] est actuellement jugée pour hérésie. Elle dit être l'envoyée du Christ, sa messagère.

Desweiteren wirft man ihr das Tragen von Männerkleidung vor und weitere Vergehen. Die Richter, bei denen es sich größtenteils um Angehörige des Klerus handelt, unterziehen die Angeklagte einer strengen Befragung.

EVTDESC_SoA_5392;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has been put through long sessions of questioning for over a month now. After much deliberation on the law and theology and evaluation of testimony the case still seems unclear to many. It all seems to come down to whether you want to believe that she is a messenger of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] or of the [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodNameCap]. Or perhaps it's more down to whether it is politically expedient to convict her or not. Young [FromFrom.GetFirstName] herself has assumed a position of sorrowful fatalism. She says she has seen her fate in a vision and that she knows what is to come.\nThe crowds surrounding the trial all await the verdict with tension. If [FromFrom.GetFirstName] were to be aquitted, the humiliation of the trial itself surely signifies that she has fallen from royal grace and will never come back to hold the position she once did. But in the case of a conviction, a gruesome death by burning at the stake is certain to be the fate that awaits her. There is little mercy for heretics.;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] subit un interrogatoire intense depuis plus d'un mois maintenant. Après de longues délibérations impliquant des textes de lois, des points de théologie et l'évaluation des témoignages, l'affaire paraît encore obscure à beaucoup.

En d'autres termes, il revient à vous de décider s'il est préférable, politiquement parlant, de la faire condamner ou innocenter. La jeune [FromFrom.GetFirstName] s'est quant à elle rangée du côté de la fatalité. Elle raconte qu'elle a vu son destin en songe et qu'elle sait ce qui l'attend.\nLa foule autour du tribunal attend le verdict avec tension. Si [FromFrom.GetFirstName] était acquittée, l'humiliation subie par le procès suffirait en elle-même à prouver que le roi l'a abandonnée et qu'elle n'aurait plus jamais le rôle qui était le sien.

Les hérétiques ne connaissent pas la miséricorde.;Nach mehr als einem Monat der Befragung [FromFrom.GetFirstName], ausführlicher Beratung über Recht und Theologie und nach Auswertung der Zeugenaussagen sind noch immer nicht alle zu einer klaren Ansicht über diesen Fall gelangt. Die zentrale Frage ist, ob man sie für eine Botschafterin Gottes oder des Teufels halten möchte. Vielleicht ist es aber auch eine Entscheidung des politischen Kalküls, ob man sie einsperren möchte oder nicht. Die junge [FromFrom.GetFirstName] selbst gibt sich einem kummervollen Fatalismus hin. Sie behauptet, ihr Schicksal in Visionen gesehen zu haben und zu wissen, was ihr bevorsteht.\nDie Volksmenge, die sich am Prozessort versammelt hat, erwartet voller Spannung die Verkündung eines Urteils. Auch wenn [FromFrom.GetFirstName] freigesprochen wird, so ist ihr Ansehen aufgrund der Anklage doch so sehr beschädigt, dass sie nicht zu ihrem alten Status zurückfinden wird. Wird sie allerdings schuldig gesprochen, so wird der qualvolle Tod auf dem Scheiterhaufen ihr Schicksal sein. Denn auf Gnade kann ein Ketzer nicht rechnen.;;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] ha sido sometida a largas sesiones de interrogatorios durante más de un mes ya. Tras muchas deliberaciones acerca de la ley y la teología y tras evaluar su testimonio, el caso sigue sin estar claro para muchos. Parece que todo se reduce a si queréis creer que es una mensajera de Dios o del Demonio. O quizá la cuestión sea si resulta oportuno políticamente declararla culpable o no. La joven [FromFrom.GetFirstName] ha asumido una postura fatalista y afligida. Dice que ha visto su destino en una visión y que sabe lo que está por venir.\nLa muchedumbre que se concentra alrededor del juicio espera el veredicto con tensión. Si [FromFrom.GetFirstName] fuera absuelta, la humillación del propio juicio significa sin duda que ha perdido la gracia real y nunca recuperará la posición que una vez tuvo. Pero en caso de condena, le aguarda una muerte espantosa, quemada en la hoguera. La misericordia para los herejes es escasa.;;;;;;;;;x

The life of this woman is coming to an end, she who captured the attention of the entire realm during these months. Saint or daedra – the eyes of the onlookers hold different views, but it seems certain that she will remembered for many many years. Perhaps she shall have her restitution in time, perhaps not.\nAs the flames climb higher and take hold of [From.GetFirstName]'s body, she twitches violently but still does not cry out.

Slowly, [From.GetFirstName] disappears from view as the flames rise around her.;Les flammes montent de plus en plus haut et crépitent alors qu'elles attaquent le bois. Lentement, [From.GetFirstName] se tord alors que le feu lui lèche les jambes. La foule assemblée fixe la scène, silencieuse, abasourdie. Certains veulent sa mort, d'autres sont submergés par l'horreur du spectacle. La vie de cette femme touche à sa fin, elle qui avait capté l'attention de tout un royaume au cours de ces derniers mois. Sainte ou démon ? Chacun a son opinion sur la question, il est cependant certain qu'elle restera dans l'esprit des gens pendant bien des années.

La vida de esta mujer está llegando a su fin, tras haber captado la atención de todo el reino durante estos meses. Santa o demoníaca. Los ojos de los espectadores tienen perspectivas distintas, pero lo que queda claro es que será recordada durante muchos años. Quizás reciba su recompensa a tiempo, o quizás no.\nCuando las llamas suben más alto y envuelven el cuerpo de [From.GetFirstName], se retuerce con violencia, pero no grita.

Hay celebraciones entre los campesinos y una mezcla de reacciones entre la nobleza y el clero. [From.GetFirstName] pasa estos días rezando.

Jeder Bischof hat eine Wertung, wobei der Papst letztlich die Entscheidung trifft.

As the High Judge of the realm, it is your official responsibility to serve as your liege's voice and will, your word carrying the same weight, and your judgements the final say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holdingjudicial10;Before the Court today stands a polarising case of a lord's wrothful nature. The Lord in question massacred the flock of a shepherd, and while this issue would normally be handled outside of the Court, it has managed to rile up the lowborn populace of the realm. On the one hand, the peasants feel the Lord has overstepped his remit, on the other, the Nobles feel the peasants are questioning their right to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holdingjudicial11;The shepherd approaches your chair, his nerves plainly obvious in the way his body shook. The rabble assembled in the room begins shouting their support to him, requiring you to call for order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holdingjudicial12;He relates to you a story of a missing sheep wandering onto the Lord's land from the public grazelands, and the wrothful lord, who regularly beat his servants, appeared like a mad-man as he ran too and fro, killing not only the sheep upon his land, but the entire flock. When the lord was done, he simply turned to the shepherd, and told him he best meet the quota, or it'll be his family next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holdingjudicial13;The Lord stands with a furious look upon his face, and approaches the bench, giving a violent scowl in the direction of the shepherd. As he stands before you, he delivers his own version of events, relating how the shepherd's flock in its entirety was destroying his prized field, and though he tried to have the shepherd remove them, the shepherd had simply laughed and turned his back. The slaughter, he explained, was the last resort of a desperate lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
