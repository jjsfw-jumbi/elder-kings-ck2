# Snow Prince
sp_claim_legacy;Claim the Legacy of the Snow Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sp_claim_legacy_desc;The last great hero of our people, known to our allies, enemies, and those few of us that remain only as the legendary "Snow Prince," was struck down thousands of years ago upon the slopes of the Moesring, slain by the vengeful scion of one of his many victims upon the field that day. So great was his ferocity in battle, and so ardent was the love our people held for him, that even our adversaries honoured him in his death, burying him in a Barrow known as Jolgeirr. As our people have made an unparalleled resurgence under your leadership, and we have found this very barrow, it is only fitting that you now don the mantle of our fallen hero, and lead us once more in to an age of glory and prosperity. We will have justice for our people yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor1title;Our Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor1desc;You've done it! You've found the tomb of our slain hero, retrieving his arms and armour from the ancient Nordic barrow. You have reclaimed the legacy of the Snow Prince for our people, and our people rejoice at the prospect of having such a hero once more. Your people cry out as you emerge from Jolgeirr, spear in hand. A cry long forgotten, not heard in many long generations of men, but known to us all, all the same: "The Snow [ROOT.GetPrincessPrince] has come!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor1opta;"Doom is at hand!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor2title;A New Snow [From.GetPrincessPrince];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor2desc;A member of the resurgent Snow Elf race by the name of [From.GetTitledName] has caused quite a stir recently by taking upon themselves the mantle of the ancient fallen Snow Prince. [From.GetSheHe] seems to have attained quite a reputation among their people, indeed, for this to be uncontested. Who can say what might lay in store for the future of the Falmer, with such bold leadership?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor2opta;Very interesting indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor_book_or_bloodline;You will require either a recognised Falmer bloodline or a relevant historical book on the subject...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Falmereth
proclaim_falmereth;Reclaim Falmereth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
proclaim_falmereth_desc;Millenia ago, our kind was expelled, driven off, and slaughtered by the races of Men, hailing from the north. We were betrayed by our brethren, who enslaved us and blinded us, in exchange for "safety". But no more.\nToday, we proclaim to the rest of the world that we, the Falmer or Snow Elves, won't be abused anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PROCLAIM_FALMERETH_EVENT_CT;You will proclaim to the world that the Snow Elves are the sole masters of Falmereth, and your descendants will be remembered as part of a glorious bloodline from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor.10.t;The Betrayed rise again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor.10.d;Slaughtered by the Nords, hated by all, betrayed by the Dwemer. Our race suffered for millenia, and most of our kind was corrupted, taking a degenerate form barely able to speak. Hundreds of years of torture and underground living made them unable to live a decent life among the other races of Tamriel.\n\nBut the last years have seen an influx of Snow Elves, safe from the corruption that plague their brethren, retake their ancestral home.\n\nAnd now, under the rule of [Root.GetTitledName], we are finally free to live in the frozen land of Skyrim, free from Nordic or Dwarven oppression!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor.10.optA;We will never kneel again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor.11.d;After their crushing defeat against the Nords, everyone slowly forgot the Falmer, even going as far as thinking the corrupted members of this once proud race were nothing more but goblin-kin.\n\nBut the world was proven wrong as they are now the sole masters of Skyrim, or Falmereth as they call the former land of the Nords.\n\nTamriel has changed. The frozen plains of Skyrim will never be the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falmer_flavor.11.optA;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
