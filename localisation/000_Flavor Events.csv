saplettingofthehistevt;You have decided the Sapletting must begin. In a great ceremony all the Tribe will gather about as your Shaman punctures the sacred Hist.

enter_sancre_tor;After dealing with the goblins you find yourself in the mighty Entry Hall of Sancre Tor, it seems some kind of necromancy was used here as the Skeletons of the old Dragonguard rise to defend their long-gone masters. Luckily, they don't seem to notice you just yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

aflavor.30.t;Dragons sighted in Tamriel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aflavor.30.d;Dragons had not been sighted in Tamriel for millenia, after the Dragon War and their presumed gradual extinction. Some people claimed to have spotted one during their travels, but most of these claims have been dismissed as either a trick of the mind, or a sinister joke.\nBut now the world has to face the truth. Dragons, called forth by [Root.GetTitledName], have been seen and heard all accross the province.\n\nTimes are changing. Will this usher a new age of Dragon rule over Tamriel?

aflavor.31.d;A once in a lifetime event occured this very morning in the Imperial Isle. At the break of dawn, the inhabitants were woken up by terrific roars, the now known sound of the great Dragons, flying towards the Imperial City.
