aflavor.30.t;Dragons sighted in Tamriel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aflavor.30.d;Dragons had not been sighted in Tamriel for millenia, after the Dragon War and their presumed gradual extinction. Some people claimed to have spotted one during their travels, but most of these claims have been dismissed as either a trick of the mind, or a sinister joke.\nBut now the world has to face the truth. Dragons, called forth by [Root.GetTitledName], have been seen and heard all accross the province.\n\nTimes are changing. Will this usher a new age of Dragon rule over Tamriel?
