#Irmaku Startup
story_wintersreturn.1.d1;The winter wind came west, from the mountains. It smashed against the legions, it broke the back of Nibenay, and it claimed White-Gold. This wind will be the one that makes Cyrodiil whole. They call us foreigners, Akaviri demons. Yet, I was born in the Valus Mountains. Am I not a child of Tamriel? And is this land not an Arena which forges empires? If they were strong, Cyrodiil would not be sundered so.\n\nWho now can stand against me? I have in my grasp the seat of empires. The Colovians band together in vain. The Nibens shriek defiance. I laugh at them all! How can they prevail when they have never known winter's bite?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_wintersreturn.1.optA;The Cyrod kings will kneel before me. And then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Nibenay Startup
story_wintersreturn.1.d2;The winter wind came west, from the mountains. It shattered northern Nibenay, pillaging her cities and seizing her land. A rude blow, to be sure, but the greatest insult was when those Akaviri barbarians sat atop the Imperial Isle and styled themselves as emperors. \nThe very idea is obscene! These Kamal claim to rule through right of conquest, but our right is nobler and older than such petty things. We Nibeneans suffered under the Ayleids' yoke. The great liberator Alessia was from Nibenay, and freed us to rule ourselves. Must a second Alessia arise to free our siblings upon the Imperial Isle?\n\nTo my chagrin, they are far too strong to fight directly - for now. I must move cautiously if Nibenay is to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_wintersreturn.1.optB;Time favors the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Colovia Startup
story_wintersreturn.1.d3;The winter wind came west, from the mountains. It brought with it heathen gods, vile slaughterers. The children of Alessia again suffer in chains at the whims of mad beasts and screaming devils. No more! Stirring in in the hearts of Colovia are the spirits of its great heroes: Bendu Olo, Rislav the Righteous, and the holy Reman Cyrodiil. They cry out for vengeance, and vengeance they shall have.\nColovia's wrath has been aroused, and it shall sweep away the barbarous court of the Kamal and the cowards of Nibenay on a tide of righteous flame. All the ancient Colovian Estates have banded together under my leadership. They placed their trust in me, and I shall not fail them. From the grim depths of my heart, with every burning fiber of my being, I swear this to thee, Cyrodiil: you shall be free and whole again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_wintersreturn.1.optC;For the glory of the Eight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Rimmen Startup
story_wintersreturn.1.d4;The winter wind came west, from the mountains. It cast the lands of Cyrod into chaos, and sent the little schemes of its kings tumbling to the ground. And who was to catch the pieces as they fell but the Tharns? We have safeguarded this land and its people since time immemorial--now we are called to clean up after Cyrodiil's passions once more.\nBut this time, it will be different. There will be no further frustrations, machinations, or foolishness to obstruct our family in the execution of its duty. We shall be a web which entangles all of Cyrodiil, from Colovia to Nibenay. We are silk. We are steel. And we are time. Let war empty Cyrodiil's veins and drown its rulers in blood. When Tamriel is dry again, we will remain, and the fruits of Empire will be ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_wintersreturn.1.optD;Patience is a virtue, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Someone else in Cyrodiil Startup
story_wintersreturn.1.d5;The winter wind came west, from the mountains. Hordes of hard-bitten Kamali, remnants of Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal's army, have carved straight to the heart of Cyrodiil. They have set themselves up in the Imperial City, styling themselves as the continuation of Reman's Empire.\n\nThe Colovian Estates have united under one banner to defend themselves from the invaders, while Nibenay takes more cautious measures. All the while, the Rim-men to the south have sworn their allegiance to this burgeoning empire. It is quickly becoming clear that there is no neutrality anymore in Cyrodiil - one kneels before the Kamal either by choice or by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_wintersreturn.1.optE;Oh, to live in more peaceful times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
