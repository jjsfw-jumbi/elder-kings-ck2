story_blackdrake.1.t;Durcorach "the Black Drake";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.1.d;One of the most ambitious and successful Reachmen of the Interregnum, Durcorach "the Black Drake" unified the Reach and swiftly conquered the Imperial Isle, subjugating most of the lords of Cyrodiil and forcing them to recognize him as Emperor.\nThe lords of High Rock rallied under the banner of Evermore, the kingdom protecting the border between High Rock and the Reach.\nThese Bretons lords will have to be subjugated, or they will prove to be a threat to the rule of the Black Drake...\n\nIn the Reach, the Hagravens seem to be willing to go to war for the Black Drake. In Skyrim, some kings seem to discuss an alliance against the Reachmen, should High Rock fall...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.1.optA;High Rock will fall, like the others!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.10.t;Reaching for an alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.10.d;The Hagravens as a whole decided to follow Durcorach "The Black Drake", who unified the Reach and marched towards the Imperial City. He then turned his eyes westwards, trying to subjugate the Bretons. While we follow him and vowed to serve him and his cause, we might have something to gain out of it.\nFor thousands of years our main coven was centered in Hraggen, where the Red Eagle himself is buried. But these lands are traditionally considered part of the [d_scarhammer.GetFullBaseName], which is controlled by the Black Drake.\nWe could send a proposal, pledging a horde of Briarhearts and Hagravens if he were to let us control that duchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.10.optA;Send a raven to the Black Drake. An alliance would be beneficial to all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.11.d;[From.GetTitledName] decided to supported our cause years ago. She, and the Hagravens she leads, have been very useful in our unification of the Reach, but she sent a new proposal. If we were to give her the [d_scarhammer.GetFullBaseName], the lands in which Hraggen is considered a part of, she would raise an army of Briarhearts and Hagravens, and send us to crush our enemies.\nWe could also refuse, claiming that the strength of the Old Gods and their followers is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.11.optA;We accept the High Crone's proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake_SCARHAMMER_FOR_TROOPS;The High Crone will raise §Ythree thousand men§! in exchange for the [d_scarhammer.GetFullBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.11.optB;We do not need to forsake our humanity to prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.12.t;Victorious Reachmen in High Rock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.12.d;Even though most of High Rock united against a common enemy, the Reachmen, our combined armies have been crushed. Morale in all of High Rock is very low, as most lords are back to their petty squabbles and the lands surrounding the Reach are now in the hands of the Black Drake, who is already plundering them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.12.optA;We will bide our time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.13.d;We are victorious! The Bretons of High Rock have been unable to fight back against our flow of bloodthirsty warriors, and now their lands are open to us! High Rock will not be able to fight back, and Evermore is already under our control.\nBut trouble is brewing in Skyrim. We must strike before the Nords do, even if our armies are tired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.13.optA;Now, to Skyrim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.13.optB;Now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.14.t;Reachmen defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.14.d;When the Black Drake declared his intention to conquer our lands, all the nobles of High Rock, in a near unique event, united against him and his hordes of Reachmen. As Evermore was on their direct border, we were the vanguard against the savages.\nNow, the savages have been defeated, and we can claim all the glory.\nEvermore stood against the Black Drake, and in it all of High Rock sent a powerful message to the Reachmen. We will not be defeated that easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.14.optA;We have proven to the lords of High Rock that they can count on us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.15.d;When we first invaded High Rock, we were expecting the Bretons to fall easily, as they spent more time fighting against one another than defending their land.\nBut against all ods, the King of Evermore managed to unite them under his banner, and crushed our armies at every turn.\nWe are now forced to admit defeat. And the Lords of Cyrodiil are watching us, eager to declare their independence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.15.optA;Trouble is brewing down south...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.16.t;Victorious Reachmen in Skyrim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.16.d;After subjugating the Bretons through their invasion of Evermore, the Reachmen launched their hordes of savages on our lands, plundering and pillaging most of Western Skyrim. The combined armies of the Nords were not enough to push them back to the Reach, and we have been forced to kneel if we wanted to keep our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.16.optA;We will bide our time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.17.d;Another crushing victory! After Evermore, now Solitude fell before our brave warriors and powerful wizards!\nThey laughed when we first united the Reachmen, they dismissed our envoyes when we conquered Cyrodiil, but now they are forced to admit it.\nThe Reachmen are triumphant.\nThis is only the beginning of our new story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.17.optA;The Reachmen are triumphant everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.18.title;Triumphant Jarls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.18.desc;After his swift conquest of High Rock, the Black Drake launched his savage armies towards Solitude, burning and pillaging every town in the way.\nBut the armies of Skyrim did what the combined forces of High Rock could not. The cold weather of Skyrim and the hard hearts of its people managed to defeat the Reachmen, and everyone in Skyrim is chanting our name.\n\nThis humiliating defeat will probably be the breaking point for the Black Drake's vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.18.optA;Skyrim will not bow to the Reachmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.19.desc;Our victory over the lords of High Rock put us in a dire situation. Our armies were tired, but Skyrim was a threat to our new empire and had to be defeated.\nBut the combined armies of the Nords managed to defeat us, something the Bretons could not do.\n\nBoth the Bretons and the Imperials could see it as the perfect time to take their independence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.19.optA;A serious blow to our ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.20.t;The Reachmen march on Solitude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.20.d;Having recently defeated the Bretons, the newly crowned Emperor of Cyrodiil, [From.GetTitledName] decided to march on our lands.\nThis army of savages, hardened by their recent conquest, vowed to plunder, burn, and sacrifice every Nord they come across.\n\nWords have already been sent to the other Jarls and petty rulers of Skyrim. In these times of need, we need to put aside our differences and do what the Bretons could not.\n\nThe Black Drake will fall, or we all will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.20.optA;For Skyrim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.21.d;We have received words from [From.GetTitledName]. Apparently, the savage [FromFrom.GetTitledName], not content with conquering High Rock, now wants to subjugage Skyrim, starting with Solitude! We have to act quickly and protect our homeland, or the Black Drake will surely conquer us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.21.optA;Call the levies, we march on the Reachmen now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
story_blackdrake.21.optB;If they cannot defend themselves, they aren't worthy of their title of Jarl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
