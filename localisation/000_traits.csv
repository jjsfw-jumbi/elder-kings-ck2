swordsinger_3_desc;This individual is on the cusp of attaining the state of "Ansei", though the concept of Shehai has yet to be achieved. They are a Master of the techniques, maneuvres and teachings of the Swordsaints and a worthy successor to Frandar Hunding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ansei_1;Ansei of the First Rank;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ansei_1_desc;The greatest among the sword-singers were known as "Saints of the Sword", or Ansei. Ansei had the ability to manifest a sword from their very soul, known as a Shehai or "Spirit Sword". All sword-singers trained to learn this form through intense training and meditation in the Way of the Sword, but not every swordsman was successful in becoming an Ansei. To become an Ansei of the first-rank, a sword-singer had to demonstrate an ability to form the Shehai, described as typically pale, misty, insubstantial and as if it was made of light. Sometimes its shape wouldn't even be particularly sword-like, and would be of no use as an actual weapon. Sword-Singers hoping to earn the title of Ansei of the First Rank were required to give up their most treasured weapons and worldly possessions, undertaking a grueling initiation ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ansei_2;Ansei of the Second Rank;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ansei_2_desc;The greatest among the sword-singers were known as "Saints of the Sword", or Ansei. Ansei had the ability to manifest a sword from their very soul, known as a Shehai or "Spirit Sword". All sword-singers trained to learn this form through intense training and meditation in the Way of the Sword, but not every swordsman was successful in becoming an Ansei. Ansei of the second-rank and above were known to have the ability to not only form the Shehai, but wield it as a weapon in battle, their Shehai shining brighter and more powerful than the Ansei of the First Rank. They were described as an unstoppable weapon of great might that could cut down foes like a scythe through wheat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ansei_3;Ansei of the Hiradirge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ansei_3_desc;The Hiradirge during the time of old Yokuda were a band of rebel Ansei that sought to establish their own form of Sword-Singing upon Yokuda, to rule it in their own Way. They were masters of so-called "stone magic" and by combining this with their knowledge of the Shehai they developed the Pankratosword, a technique so devastating in it's power that it could unfurl the laws of nature and matter itself. When their rebellion faltered and their army broken, the remaining Hiradirge combined their Pankratosword techniques and shattered the continent of Yokuda. This fearsome power was once hoped lost to time but it seems this person has relearned the ancient forgotten technique, it remains to be seen if they will use it wisely or if they will be the ending of this kalpa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
