BM_INTERREGNUM_ERA;2E: The Interregnum;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_INTERREGNUM_ERA_INFO;Twenty years ago, the last Akaviri Potentate and all of his heirs were murdered, ending the Second Empire. Cyrodiil, High Rock and Skyrim are now split between dozens of rival successor-states, former subjects of the Empire who struggle with one another over even the smallest of resources. Most of Tamriel fares no better, with regional hostilities gripping nearly every region outside of Alinor. In all this chaos, is it possible for the Empire to be restored? Can any individual possibly hope to pacify the turbulence and stand above all others as the Emperor of not only Cyrodiil, but of all of Tamriel? Anything is possible amidst the chaos of the Interregnum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_REACHMEN_ERA;2E: The Black Drake;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_REACHMEN_ERA_INFO;The lands of the Bretons stand in the shadow of the Black Drake. Bands of furious Reachmen, buoyed by monumental victories in Cyrodiil and thirsting for new pillage, have arrived at the gates of Evermore with the intention of conquering every last crag and meadow in High Rock. A coalition of Breton rulers has formed, desperate to halt the advances of the Black Drake's Empire. Meanwhile, the recently-subjugated Imperial vassals in Cyrodiil are keenly waiting for a moment to strike, in order to oust the Reachmen and restore the Empire back to Cyrodilic rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_KAMAL_ERA;2E: The Kamal Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KAMAL_ERA_INFO;Skyrim and Morrowind are in disarray as the barbarous Kamal under the command of Emperor Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal sweep across the northeast of Tamriel, destroying anything that dares to stand in their way. No one in Tamriel has discerned any reason why the Akaviri ruler would lead his troops on such an ambitious campaign, but the Nords and Dunmer do understand that they have no choice but to cooperate if they are to have any hope of repelling their attackers. In these unusual times, even the Argonians, long-standing enemies of the Dunmer, have shown a willingness to assist in the effort to drive the ferocious Kamal back to the sea and out of Tamriel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_VARENSREBELLION;2E: Varen's Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_VARENSREBELLION_DESC;The legalisation of Daedra worship by Emperor Leovic was the last straw to the discontent Colovian lords of Cyrodiil. Leadered by Varen Aquilarios of Chorrol, the Colovians are keen to retake the Empire for the Divines faithful. Unfortunately, while the construction of Varen's Wall between Chorrol and Kvatch just before the conflict started protected the city from the Emperor's legions, it also allowed Anvil, still under imperial authority, to invade Kvatch unopposed, with the exception of an ambitious pirate queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ALLIANCEWAR_ERA;2E: The Alliance War;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ALLIANCEWAR_ERA_INFO;When Mannimarco, the King of Worms, corrupted the Amulet of Kings just before Emperor Varen's coronation ritual several years ago, he guaranteed that the covenant sealed by Alessia and Akatosh would be broken, and Nirn would no longer be protected from a Daedric invasion. Mannimarco's master, the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, seized the opportunity to initiate the Planemeld, using terrifying Dark Anchors to summon Daedric troops and drag Nirn into the realm of Coldharbour. But three political alliances - the Ebonheart Pact, Daggerfall Covenant and Aldmeri Dominion - stand against the Daedric Prince and his forces. The armies of the three alliances converge, ready to fight to the last to preserve their freedom. Never before have the disparate races cooperated so closely, but never before has the threat been so terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Never before have the disparate races cooperated so closely, but never before has the threat been so terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_POSTBANNER;2E: Post-Banner War;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_POSTBANNER_DESC;The Alliance War is over. With Mannimarco slain and Molag Bal defeated in Coldharbour, the Three Banners once again turned their sights on the Ruby Throne and the smoldering remains of the Cyrodilic Empire. With no side able to secure the Ruby Throne, the Empire quickly shattered, and with its mission fulfilled, the Ebonheart Pact claimed victory and dissolved peacefully. The Daggerfall Covenant wavers, no longer counting Orsinium as one of its own, while the Breton lords squabble amongst themselves. The Aldmeri Dominion has ceased to be, with all but a handful of rulers beyond Summerset rejecting Ayrenn's rulership. As Tamriel's great powers fragment, other realms seek opportunities to secure their frontiers, expand their borders, and potentially move towards reestablishing the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WARLORDRISING;2E: War for Rimmen;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WARLORDRISING_DESC;Having subjugated the petty lords of Cyrodiil one by one, the warlord Attrebus - a fanatical follower of the Eight and sworn enemy of Daedra-worshipers - crowned himself Emperor and began his campaign to rid the Heartland of spiritual corruption. Suspected of vampiric connections and threatened by Attrebus with death, the fanged Tsaesci and their Akaviri kin fled to the independent Rimmen kingdom. Attrebus and his army followed. Badly outnumbered, Queen Lyra has surrendered her independence to the Mane of the Khajiit in hopes that his army will be enough to defeat the forces of the reformed Cyrodilic Empire and protect both her and her new subjects from the warlord's wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WINTERSRETURN;2E: Winter's Return;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WINTERSRETURN_DESC;The defeat of Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal centuries ago coincided with the complete dissolution of the Kamal invasion force that threatened Skyrim and Morrowind. Unbeknown to the people of Tamriel, a small pocket of this invasion force survived the war, hiding in the Valus Mountains. Their descendants, few in number but great in ferocity, launched a surprise invasion of the Heartland and took the Imperial City, reestablishing the Empire as a Kamal state. The Akaviri of Rimmen, alienated by their Khajiit overlords, have abandoned Elsweyr and thrown in with the Kamal. Although it is unlikely that the Kamal occupiers will maintain their power for long, it is equally unlikely that they will rest on their laurels, and will soon search for new targets to conquer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DOMINIONOFMER;2E: The Dominion of Mer;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DOMINIONOFMER_DESC;A succession war between Camoran pretenders in Valenwood has resulted in the formation of the Second Aldmeri Dominion. When his rivals turned to the Colovian Estates for military aid, Anaxemes Camoran responded by calling upon the King of Alinor. Altmer intervention resulted in Anaxemes' complete victory and his establishment as a vassal king under the Aldmeri Dominion. Valenwood is now a sworn enemy of their Colovian neighbors and the Dominion has secured alliances with Elsweyr, Pyandonea, and the Reach. With Cyrodiil in tatters, it appears as though the Dominion may be poised to take control of Tamriel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EMPERORZERO;2E: Emperor Zero;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EMPERORZERO_DESC;One after another, the rulers of Cyrodiil find themselves kneeling before the Colovian warlord Cuhlecain. Originally the petty King of Falkreath, Cuhlecain has completely uprooted the balance of power in Tamriel, thanks in no small part to his seemingly-invincible general, Talos. Talos is recognised by the Greybeards of High Hrothgar as Dragonborn. General Talos' tactical genius and use of the Voice has secured Cuhlecain shocking victories, first at Old Hroldan, and now at Sancre Tor. With the Amulet of Kings in his possession and no enemies strong enough to oppose him, Cuhlecain merely needs to sweep up a few weak rulers, take the Imperial City, and crown himself Emperor to solidify his rule once and for all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_210006;Emperor Reman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_210006;Reman is a young colovian warlord, now crowned emperor of all Cyrods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_36001;King Hidellith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_36001;Hidellith, Altmer King of Alinor - The lands of the High Elves blossom in a golden age under the wise and gracious rule of King Hidellith. He is a well-liked, traditional Ceremoniarch who follows practically every precedent set by the ancient Scrolls of Praxis. While most of Tamriel is war-torn and devastated, Alinor is relatively peaceful and wealthy. However, Hidellith's ways make him a target for the ambitions of younger, forward-thinking Altmer who consider his practices fanciful and outdated, to say nothing of foreign adversaries who view him as a predictable and therefore vulnerable target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_30003;King Erasmo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_30003;Erasmo, Bosmer King of Falinesti - The founding of House Camoran marked the first year of the First Era. The Camorans' historical influence is indisputable, but the family's power is disintegrating. King Erasmo does not want to be remembered as the one who oversaw the collapse of this noble dynasty, and has set out to reconquer the territory that his family once ruled over. It will be an difficult endeavor for the aged King of Falinesti, but if he acts before any of his rivals can increase in strength, he should be able to reestablish Camoran rule over Valenwood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_100;Lord Protector Caius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_100;Caius, Lord Protector of the Heartlands - The Interregnum is a time when nothing can be taken for granted except the likelihood of war, and Lord Protector Caius has profited during the uncertainty and turmoil more than perhaps any other man in Cyrodiil. He is no Emperor, but instead rules as a merchant-king. Since his home base is the rich Imperial Isle and his trade lanes are Lake Rumare and the Niben River, living as a mercantile ruler has been extremely lucrative for Caius. Nonetheless, his direct political influence over Cyrodiil is minor, and his military strength is anemic. Caius needs to rapidly consolidate his power or face an onslaught of foes who all desire the treasures he holds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_66001;Mane Ma'randru-jo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_66001;Ma'randru-jo, Mane of Elsweyr - Ma'randru-jo is the direct successor of Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the first Mane of the Khajiit, and is believed to be his reincarnation. Every action during his 60-year rule has been carefully scrutinized by his subjects, due to the expectation that he would live up to his former self's greatness. Ma'randru-jo's rule has been prosperous, but Elsweyr is in a delicate position. Senchal and Orcrest acknowledge the Mane as their rightful ruler but refuse to submit to his authority. The Alkosh-worshippers to the north pay little heed to the Mane at all. Elven and Cyrodilic foreigners threaten Khajiiti lands with raids and conquests. To protect his people, the Mane may need to conquer them first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_66753;Ja'arana Bahdrashi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_66753;Bahdrashi, Pellitinian Ja'arana of Corinthe - The only living child of Mane Ma'randru-jo, Bahdrashi was raised in the lap of luxury and was expected by her father to become one of his closest allies. It was at his behest that she came into power in Corinthe, where she has ruled successfully for some time. As the Mane grows old, Bahdrashi understands that soon, she will lose her father and her greatest supporter. She is aware that once a new Mane is discovered, other vassals may attempt to use her as a pawn in their own bids for power. But why allow others to use her, when she can wield her own might to increase her own influence? She is no Mane, but has as much a claim to Elsweyr as any other Khajiit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_120577;Va-Tsii Iria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_120577;Iria, Tsaesci Va-Tsii of Gorling - Peace and stability in the ancient matriarchies of the Tsaesci came to a screeching halt with the rise of Iria Qou, a merciless and sadistic warmonger. She desires to be the ruler of all Tsaesci, a feat which has never been accomplished. Most of the other matriarchs scoff at the notion that they will bend the knee to Iria, but the Va-Tsii of Gorling has already split nearby Meralang into two pieces, and she intends to conquer the rest of it very soon. Iria's own vassals do not much like her, and she absolutely needs to find allies to secure her dynasty's hold on Gorling. After that, the rest of Tsaesci lands might just be hers for the taking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_18040;Emperor Durcorach;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_18040;Durcorach the Black Drake, Reachman Emperor of Cyrodiil - Some years ago, a chieftain of middling power descended from the misty crags of the Reach with unabated furor and cut a bloody swathe through Skyrim and Cyrodiil. Now, Durcorach calls himself Emperor of Cyrodiil, and with control of the Imperial Isle and a marriage with the Tharn family, is a truer Emperor than any of the short-lived pretenders who recently preceded him. Nonetheless, a Reachman--and one who is sworn to Daedra, no less--as Emperor has many foes. The many rulers of High Rock, in particular, are hostile to him. The Black Drake must decimate their armies, scorch their lands and plunder their cities if he wishes to subjugate the Bretons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15522;King Heseph;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15522;Heseph, Breton King of Evermore - Evermore's location along the borders with Hammerfell and the Reach has always made the Breton kingdom a target for raids. However, King Heseph must face a far more terrifying threat than anything his predecessors dealt with. The armies of a unified Reach lay siege to his city, and Heseph has been forced to call on aid from the rest of High Rock in an effort to stem the tide. Too proud to flee, King Heseph, the last of the old House Moile, prepares to make his last stand against overwhelming odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15028;King Baldrick;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15028;Baldrick, Breton King of Wayrest - Baldrick is the single wealthiest and most powerful Breton in all of Tamriel. On one hand, he is well-regarded as the model of the successful Breton king. On the other hand, lesser Breton rulers constantly pressure him to intervene whenever a significant foreign enemy attacks High Rock. Presently, Baldrick leads the shaky coalition formed to defeat the Reachmen under Durcorach. With Evermore in grave danger, Baldrick must quickly organize the disparate Breton forces and repulse the Daedra-worshipping invaders before the Black Drake can turn the great cities of High Rock into smouldering ruins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3600;King Abnur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3600;Abnur, Nibenese King of Nibenay - The enigmatic Abnur is the patriarch of the Tharn family, a storied dynasty with a reputation for political pragmatism, stringency and magical affinity. The Nibenese wizard-king exemplifies all three of these traits better than perhaps any of his ancestors. When Abnur aligned himself with Durcorach and the Reachmen-led Cyrodilic Empire, he did so for political advancement. When he went to war on behalf of those same Daedra-worshippers, he did so unapologetically. And when he applied his arcane powers to prolong his life, he did so with flawless precision that left him functionally immortal. Many do not like him, but few disrespect the brilliance and might of the Nibenay Valley's greatest mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_9112;Queen Mabjaarn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_9112;Mabjaarn, Nord Queen of Eastmarch - The young and untested Mabjaarn is faced with a rather unenviable political situation. She may control the most powerful kingdom in Skyrim, but she is a neighbor of the burgeoning Cyrodilic Empire. The Nords and Reachmen are historical enemies and as Durcorach's armies win battle after battle, there is a very real chance that they will move east and assail the three Nord kingdoms. Mabjaarn may soon be called in to defend her countrymen, or worse, be attacked directly by her western enemies. Fortunately, she has youth on her side, and if she can adapt to her challenges, may have decades of wise rule and conquest ahead of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_124502;King Bardak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_124502;Bardak, Kamal King of Kazedirica - Less than ten years ago, Bardak Nimidi was merely a subsistence farmer and herdsman. But the persecution of his fellow Winter Wind faithful enraged the fanatical Bardak and drove him to spark a rebellion that quickly overthrew the ruling Sekbin dynasty and chose him as the new leader. Despite lacking any formal military training (or aptitude for personal combat), he is a military genius imbued with zeal and charisma. Bardak wishes to depose all the independent Four Winds rulers, and his first target is his powerful neighbor, King Soom Dir-Kamal. The declaration of war, made in the first days of winter, is a symbolic statement from Bardak the Winter Wind will prevail over all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_123093;Emperor Ada'Soom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_123093;Ada'Soom, Kamal Emperor of Kamal - With icy eyes, an ominous, tattooed countenance and a vast army of fearless warriors, Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal is referred to by the people of Tamriel as an "Akaviri demon." A few months ago, Ada'Soom and his Kamal hordes swept into Skyrim with the intent to conquer Tamriel, decimating all who dared to stand in the way. He dealt a serious blow to Skyrim when he sacked Windhelm, and slew High Queen Mabjaarn and her daughter and brief successor, Nurnhilde. As his second army lands in Morrowind for the second phase of his invasion, Ada'Soom has the freedom to choose whether to deal the final blow to Skyrim and conquer it outright, or test his mettle against the seemingly-invincible Tribunal and take Morrowind as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_9115;King Jorunn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_9115;Jorunn, Nord High King of Skyrim - Jorunn was thrust into the position of Skyrim's High King following the deaths of his mother Mabjaarn and older sister Nurnhilde at the hands of the Kamal, and is trained not as a warrior or politician, but as a bard. Yet, Jorunn lives in unconventional times, and his unusual skillset, his daring and resourcefulness, and his favour with the Greybeards are all advantageous attributes in this chaotic era. If he can make the most of what he has available--as an adventurous bard is trained to do--Jorunn may even be remembered as one of the greatest champions of the Nord ways that Skyrim has ever had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_48307;Archmagister Manel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_48307;Manel, Dunmer Archmagister of Great House Telvanni - Telvanni Archmagisters such as Manel are ordinarily known for their pervasive arrogance, abrasiveness and isolationism. None of these attitudes have helped Manel evade the overbearing might of the Kamal, and he has been forced to swallow his pride and request aid from the rival Great Houses. Even with the begrudging aid of the other Great Houses and the Tribunal Temple, the situation for the Telvanni looks bleak. Foreign assistance may be required, but with the Nords occupied with Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal's main force, and the peoples of Cyrodiil bracing for a civil war, only the realms of the Argonians, sworn enemies to the Dunmer, even have so much as the potential to assist in this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_60200;High Chieftess Heita-Meen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_60200;Heita-Meen, Argonian High Chieftess of Sarpa - Heita-Meen is a revolutionary Argonian in more ways than one. Quite recently, she escaped the bonds of slavery, violently overthrew her Dunmer captors and liberated her people. Now, she seeks to make friends of the Argonians' traditional rivals as war rages throughout Tamriel. A vision from the Hist directed her to send warriors to aid against the Kamal, which she eagerly heeded. While the Argonians no longer count the Dunmer as true adversaries, they are still not unified and need direction. To her credit, Heita-Meen is a proven leader with exceptional willpower. Perhaps this former rebel is the one most worthy of being Argonia's Queen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_39000;King Orgnum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_39000;Orgnum, Maormer King of Pyandonea - Orgnum claims to be an Aldmeri god whose powers place him in the company of deities such as Auri-El, Trinimac and Magnus. While his alleged divinity is certainly disputable, what is not up for debate is that he is an immortal mage-king with immense powers, intense avarice, and an entire island of Maormer worshippers who consider gazing upon his visage to be an exquisite honour. Orgnum wishes to rule Alinor and is known to periodically raise armies, launch fleets and assail the Altmer, but has never succeeded in attaining his ultimate goal. However, Orgnum is persistent and his agelessness means that he can always try again...and again...and again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_301010;Empress-Regent Clivia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_301010;Clivia, Nibenean Empress of the Cyrodilic Empire - Clivia Tharn is a political warrior, raised on her father's intrigues and behind-closed-doors machinations but trained in the ways of politics, diplomacy and rhetoric. Long groomed to be a ruler in her own right, Clivia jealously guards her new-found position as Empress-Regent following her husband Varen's mysterious disappearance. But with the advent of the Soulburst, the Imperial City was lost to an army of cultists, undead and Daedra under Mannimarco's command. Clivia must rally her armies not only to retake her capital, but because if these hostile forces are not stopped soon, all of Tamriel may be pulled straight into the Daedric realm of Coldharbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_300116;Herald Mannimarco;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_300116;Mannimarco, King of Worms - Mannimarco caused one of the worst catastrophes in Tamrielic history when he corrupted the Amulet of Kings, causing the Soulburst to occur during the now-missing Emperor Varen's coronation ritual. A sworn ally and emissary of the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, Mannimarco commands a vast army with the purpose of stopping all opposition to the Planemeld that threatens to bring all of Tamriel into Coldharbor. However, Mannimarco is not known for his honour or loyalty, and it is possible that he is using this chaos not to serve Molag Bal, but to take his master's place to become ruler of Coldharbour and Nirn all at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_36007;High Queen Ayrenn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_36007;Ayrenn, Altmer High Queen of the Aldmeri Dominion - Unlike the leaders of the other two alliances, Ayrenn's position as head of the Aldmeri Dominion is not merely out of respect, but also a matter of law. Recently, Ayrenn mustered a force to end the in-fighting in Valenwood and secure the region under the rule of a single Camoran heir, who gratefully acknowledged Ayrenn as his liege lady. Shortly thereafter, she received the fealty of the Khajiit, who desperately sought allies in the wake of the Soulburst. In contrast to the rival alliances, Ayrenn's newly-forged Aldmeri Dominion is chiefly concerned with one matter - bringing all of Tamriel under elven rule, her rule, which she believes will bring the continent back to its halcyon Merethic days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15123;King Emeric;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15123;Emeric, Breton High King of the Daggerfall Covenant - A veteran warrior and masterful politician, King Emeric is one of the most respected individuals in the Iliac Bay and the de facto leader of the Daggerfall Covenant. His diplomatic talents allowed him to win over the Redguards and the Orsimer as allies. His record as a fighter, including killing the Emperor Durcorach in battle and scattering the Black Drake's army, earned him the respect of his fellow Bretons, who know him as a man of action and a defender of all of High Rock. Emeric's mission is a simple one - stop the Planemeld to save Tamriel, and re-establish the Empire as a cornerstone of unity, peace and prosperity for all under its banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_6629B;King Attrebus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_6629B;Attrebus, Colovian King of Falkreath - Raised on the war-torn frontier of Falkreath Hold and the Reach, Attrebus grew up leading sorties and hunting down Witchman raiders. A witness to some of the worst atrocities committed by Reachmen - and later, Daedric warriors - during the Alliance War, Attrebus' heart turned to stone. Enraged by the death of his mother during one of the closing skirmishes of the Alliance War, Attrebus swore a campaign of revenge against the Reachmen and all others who served Molag Bal. He declared Cyrodiil a land of festering corruption, and after rallying an army of adventurers, ex-mercenaries and former farmers, made his move on the Ruby Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_18088;King Alabcain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_18088;Alabcain, Reachman King of the Reach - The ruthless Alabcain is known as the "Despot of Markarth," and for good reason. He is uncompromising, uncouth and unafraid to make enemies provided he thinks he can destroy them. Alabcain rules the fractious Reachman clans with an iron fist, sponsoring the more ambitious to venture into Skyrim and High Rock in search of plunder during the Alliance War. Despite his infamous status as one of the few independent rulers who aligned with Mannimarco and Molag Bal, he has managed to defend the Reach against retaliatory attacks. With all the great Alliances dissolving, Alabcain wonders if the time is right to expand the borders of the Reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_42104;King Bazrag;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_42104;Bazrag, Orsimer King of Orsinium - Bazrag's ascent to the throne of Orsinium came following the failure of Kurog, his predecessor and former friend, to unite the Orsimer tribes. With Orsinium's membership in the Daggerfall Covenant predicated on Kurog's agreement with High King Emeric, Bazrag found himself with no external allies. Orsinium is a young kingdom and the notion of a unified Orc state intimidates Bazrag's neighbors, all of whom would be happy to see the warmongering zealot of Malacath dethroned. But Emeric's heirs lack his authority and in due time, the Daggerfall Covenant may cease to exist. If so, the newly-crowned King of Orsinium may have a golden opportunity to expand his nation's borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_136500;Queen Lyra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_136500;Lyra, Akaviri Queen of the Rim - Although a granddaughter of the notorious Nibenese wizard-lord Abnur Tharn, and a Tharn by name, Lyra has little Nibenean cultural values ingrained upon her. Her father was a mercenary captain of Akaviri heritage, and she took after her father not only in appearance, but in culture as well. When Attrebus began persecuting the Akaviri and Tsaesci residents of Cyrodiil, the sympathetic Lyra welcomed them with open arms. This enraged the self-proclaimed Emperor of Cyrodiil and drew the two into a conflict over the Rim. Outnumbered, Lyra turned to the Mane of Elsweyr, swearing fealty in exchange for protection against the Colovian warlord's machinations and beginning the Rim's history as a multicultural client of the Elsweyr Confederacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_66009;Mane Ma'Jidarr;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_66009;Ma'Jidarr, Pellitinian Mane of Elsweyr - Ma'Jidarr is young, yet wise beyond his years. Unlike most of his recent predecessors, this Mane is exceptionally ambitious and adaptable, seeking opportunities and seizing them as they become available. The brewing war between the Empire and the Rim provided him the perfect opportunity to prove his capability to all. Ma'Jidarr has offered Lyra Tharn his protection in exchange for unwavering fealty, and aspires to not only place the Rim under Elsweyr's banner, but seize the wealthy western bank of the River Niben between his claws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_6629;Emperor Attrebus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_6629;Attrebus, Colovian Emperor of Cyrodiil - A self-proclaimed purifier of Daedric influences, Attrebus is one of the most feared men in Tamriel. As Emperor, he has ordered the persecution and elimination of Daedra-worshiping subjects, particularly those aligned with Molag Bal. To Attrebus, the fanged, blood-drinking Tsaesci are extremely suspicious, and their Akaviri kin are hardly any better. As this has caused many to flee to the Rim, Attrebus now turns his focus to the cosmopolitan kingdom which he aims to decimate utterly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_6105;King Carolus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_6105;Carolus Aquilarios, Colovian King of Kvatch - Nephew of Varen Aquilarios, former Emperor of Cyrodiil, Carolus built his reputation as a steadfast defender of Kvatch during Varen's rebellion and later, during the Alliance War. With shrewd political manoeuvring and the aid of assassins, Carolus took control of the entire Gold Coast. Aside from skirmishes with neighboring Skingrad, Rihad and Valenwood, Carolus' reign has been a peaceful one. With much of Cyrodiil subject to Emperor Attrebus' reign of terror, Kvatch shines as a beacon of stability and prosperity...which makes the Kingdom and Carolus himself targets for would-be usurpers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_36007B;Queen Ayrenn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_36007B;Ayrenn, Altmer Queen of Alinor - The inability of the Aldmeri Dominion to capture the Ruby Throne marked what the Unforeseen Queen's subjects perceived as an abject failure, not only for her, but as the backbone of the Dominion's mandate. Valenwood and Elsweyr both declared independence in the wake of the Alliance War, but this is a mere setback for someone as driven as Ayrenn. Still quite young by Altmer standards, she has already outlived nearly all of her rivals from the days of the Planemeld, and the continued instability in Tamriel is ineffable proof in her eyes that her efforts to bring peace and prosperity to the Arena must be redoubled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_30068;Queen Beleval;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_30068;Beleval, Bosmer Queen of Valenwood - Beleval Camoran, irritated by persistent territorial encroachment from Colovia, supplication to the High Queen of Alinor and an ongoing but inconclusive rivalry with Elsweyr, declared independence from the Aldmeri Dominion once the dissolution of the Empire was all but clear. An intense isolationist with passionate hatred for each of her neighbors, Beleval's cunning is the only thing keeping her tenuous reign afloat. Stunning victories against Alinor have allowed her to reclaim most of Valenwood, but anti-Dominion sentiment has faded over the past two decades, and the number of Bosmer warriors willing to go on the offensive has dwindled as a result, once again placing Valenwood into a precarious situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
