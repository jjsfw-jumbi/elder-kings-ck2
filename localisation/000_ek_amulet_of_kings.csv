AmuletOfKings10A;My only realistic means to light the Dragonfires is with the Amulet of Kings. [ek_amulet_owner.GetBestName] holds the Red Diamond, and I will need to speak to [ek_amulet_owner.GetHerHim] in order to recover the Amulet.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings10B;My only realistic means to light the Dragonfires is with the Amulet of Kings. The Amulet has not been seen in the Imperial City for decades - perhaps even centuries - and the only logical place where it could be found is in the old Tomb of the Reman Emperors, in Sancre Tor.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings10OptA;I will speak to [ek_amulet_owner.GetFirstName] at once.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings10OptB;I'll begin preparations for the journey immediately.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings15;[From.GetBestName] arrived at my court today with a most peculiar request. [From.GetSheHeCap] wants to ignite the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One, and has asked me for the Amulet of Kings!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings15Accept;Of course. Please, take the Amulet, with my compliments.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings15Decline;The Amulet is mine. Begone!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings15Compromise;The Amulet is mine, but perhaps we can work together...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings15CompromiseTooltip;You suggest a devious plan to fool the world into thinking you lit the Dragonfires...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings20;How fortuitous! [From.GetFirstName] has graciously given me the Amulet of Kings!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings20Accept;A wondrous turn of events.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings25;[From.GetFirstName] has refused to offer me the Amulet of Kings, shooing me away like some common peasant! I may need to take a different approach.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings25OptA;I'm sorry [From.GetFirstName], but I must have the Amulet.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings25OptB;Perhaps there is another way...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings30;[From.GetFirstName] wishes for me to light the Dragonfires, on the condition that [From.GetSheHe] not only keeps the Amulet of Kings, but takes all the credit for it!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings30OptA;Unacceptable. I'm taking the Amulet.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings30OptB;Unacceptable. But there must be another way.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings30OptC;It's a deal, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings40;"I'm sorry," [FromFrom.GetFirstName] says to me. Before I can even react, I am stabbed with a hidden blade. I drop to the floor, and [FromFrom.GetFirstName] seizes the Amulet of Kings, running away.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings40Accept;It is so cold...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings41;"I'm sorry," [FromFrom.GetFirstName] says to me. Before I can even react, I am stabbed with a hidden blade. With my last breath, I draw my weapon and wound [FromFrom.GetFirstName], but the fiend has stolen the Amulet of Kings and fled, leaving me for dead.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings41Accept;It is so cold...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings42;"I'm sorry," I say to [From.GetFirstName]. Before [From.GetSheHe] can even react, I stab [From.GetHerHim] with a concealed blade. But the wound is only superficial, and [From.GetFirstName] counterattacks with [From.GetHerHis] weapon, and I collapse to the ground, fatally wounded.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings42Accept;It is so cold...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings43;"I'm sorry," I say to [From.GetFirstName]. Just as I ready a concealed blade, [From.GetFirstName] draws a weapon and fatally wounds me. I collapse to the ground, dropping my weapon with me.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings43Accept;It is so cold...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings45;"I'm sorry," I say to [From.GetFirstName]. Before [From.GetSheHe] can even react, I stab [From.GetHerHim] with a concealed blade. [From.GetSheHeCap] drops to the floor, and I seize the Amulet of Kings, making a hasty retreat.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings45Accept;The Amulet of Kings is mine!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings46;"I'm sorry," I say to [From.GetFirstName]. Before [From.GetSheHe] can even react, I stab [From.GetHerHim] with a concealed blade. [From.GetSheHeCap] drops to the floor, but not before wounding me with [From.GetHerHis] own weapon. I seize the Amulet of Kings, making a hasty retreat.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings46Accept;The Amulet of Kings is mine!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings47;"I'm sorry," [FromFrom.GetFirstName] says to me. Sensing an impending attack, I draw my weapon and quickly strike [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] falls to the ground, dead, dropping a blade with [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. My instincts have served me well.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings47Accept;Another corpse for the pile...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings48;"I'm sorry," [FromFrom.GetFirstName] says to me. Sensing an impending attack, I draw my weapon and quickly strike [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] stabs me with a concealed blade, but my attacker's wounds are more severe than my own, and [FromFrom.GetFirstName] lies dead. My instincts have served me well.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings48Accept;Another corpse for the pile...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings50A;Armed with the Amulet of Kings, I enter the Imperial City and make my way to the Temple District. It is inside the Temple of the One that I will be able to reignite the Dragonfires.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings50B;I am not sure if I am welcome in the Imperial City, but no one has noticed my presence. Keeping a low profile, I make my way to the Temple District. It is inside the Temple of the One that I will be able to reignite the Dragonfires.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings50Accept;So be it.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings55;As I wonder what my next step should be, a strange [amulet_blades_agent.GetManWoman] dressed in monastic robes walks up to me, and clutching my arm, leans in to my ear. "My name is [amulet_blades_agent.GetFirstName]. I know what you're up to and I want to help," [amulet_blades_agent.GetSheHe] whispers. "Only a hero blessed by Akatosh should have the Amulet. You are that hero. Tomorrow, it will be yours." [amulet_blades_agent.GetFirstName] gives me directions to a tavern I am supposed to wait at until I receive further directions.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings55Accept;This better be worth it.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings60;The Amulet of Kings has been stolen! Thieves must have made off with it. I do not know who took the Amulet, but I suspect that it must have been an agent working for [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings60Accept;That bastard!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings65;The inn is broken-down and filthy. I can barely even breathe with this unbearable stench...suddenly [amulet_blades_agent.GetFirstName] approaches and hands me a small canvas pouch. "Don't open it here," [amulet_blades_agent.GetSheHe] directs me. "But you may find it useful in days to come.";;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings65Accept;Why...thank you...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings70;I arrive in the Imperial City with [FromFrom.GetBestName]. Posing as a bodyguard in [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s service, I will be the only one who accompanies [FromFrom.GetHerHim] into the Temple of the One. What transpires in there will be between the two of us.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings70Accept;Very well. On with it.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings75;Following a parade from the gates to the Temple District, my entourage reaches the Temple of the One. [From.GetFirstName] and I enter, leaving everyone else waiting outside. I hand the Amulet of Kings to [From.GetFirstName] and standing over the ancient brazier, we complete the ritual. Flames erupt upwards, and [From.GetFirstName] and I look at one another and nod.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings75Accept;I've done it!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings80;The ritual is a success! [From.GetFirstName] and I look toward one another as the Dragonfires burn, illuminating the Temple. After a moment, I consider that if my blood was key to lighting the Dragonfires, and [From.GetFirstName] can't even wear the Amulet of Kings, then [From.GetSheHe] has outlived [From.GetHerHis] purpose. I could kill [From.GetHerHim] right here and the Dragonfires would continue to burn.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings80OptA;It would be wrong to kill [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKingsGoHome;Your task completed, you return home.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings80OptB;This charade is a disgrace. And the Amulet is mine!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings90;I turn to look back at the Dragonfires, content with our accomplishment. As long as we keep this secret, Nirn will be all the better for it. But...I suddenly feel a stabbing pain. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has plunged a dagger into me! I struggle, screaming for help, but I am rapidly losing my blood and fall to the floor, dying.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings90Accept;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]...you...backstabber...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings91;I turn to look back at the Dragonfires, content with our accomplishment. As long as we keep this secret, Nirn will be all the better for it. But...I suddenly feel a stabbing pain. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has plunged a dagger into me! I draw my weapon and fight back, and am able to wound [FromFrom.GetFirstName], but I am rapidly losing my blood and fall to the floor, dying.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings91Accept;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]...you...backstabber...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings92;[From.GetFirstName] turns back to the Dragonfires, gazing upon the sacred blaze. Realizing the opportunity, I draw a hidden dagger but [From.GetSheHe] notices and draws [From.GetHerHis] weapon. Although I badly wound [From.GetFirstName], my wounds are far more severe and I suddenly drop to the floor, dying.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings92Accept;You fool! You didn't deserve this...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings93;[From.GetFirstName] turns back to the Dragonfires, gazing upon the sacred blaze. Realizing the opportunity, I draw a hidden dagger but [From.GetSheHe] notices and draws [From.GetHerHis] weapon. I find myself outmatched by [From.GetFirstName], and succumbing to my wounds, I suddenly drop to the floor and breathe my last.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings93Accept;You fool! You didn't deserve this...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings95;[From.GetFirstName] turns back to the Dragonfires, gazing upon the sacred blaze. Realizing the opportunity, I draw a hidden dagger and plunge it into [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] struggles and screams for help, but it is in vain. I pull the Amulet off of [From.GetHerHis] corpse and hang it around my neck.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings95Accept;It is finished.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings96;[From.GetFirstName] turns back to the Dragonfires, gazing upon the sacred blaze. Realizing the opportunity, I draw a hidden dagger and plunge it into [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] fights back and screams for help, but although I am injured, [From.GetHerHis] act is in vain. I pull the Amulet off of [From.GetHerHis] corpse and hang it around my neck.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings96Accept;It is finished.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings97;I turn to look back at the Dragonfires, content with our accomplishment. As long as we keep this secret, Nirn will be all the better for it. But I see [FromFrom.GetFirstName] drawing a weapon and looking right at me! I draw my weapon and fight back, and am able to kill [FromFrom.GetFirstName], but I am badly wounded in the process.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings97Accept;That lousy backstabber!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings98;I turn to look back at the Dragonfires, content with our accomplishment. As long as we keep this secret, Nirn will be all the better for it. But I see [FromFrom.GetFirstName] drawing a weapon and looking right at me! I draw my weapon and fight back, and am able to kill [FromFrom.GetFirstName], who drops to the floor in a heap.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings98Accept;That lousy backstabber!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings100;Guards rush in, hearing the commotion. They see me covered in blood, with the Amulet of Kings about my neck, and [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s corpse at my feet, but they do not threaten me. They gaze upon the Dragonfires and confer for a moment, and lead me out of the Temple of the One. There, the captain of the guards raises her weapon and exclaims "Hail Dragonborn! Hail [Root.GetBestName]!" The other guards follow suit, and the crowd of citizens gathered around the Temple erupts into cheers.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings100Accept;The Dragonblood is strong within me.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings101;[From.GetFirstName] and I open the doors to the Temple of the One. The crowd that has gathered outside sees the Dragonfires burning brightly. Though I cannot wear the Amulet of Kings, this fact is moot - the Dragonfires shall burn once more, and I will take all the credit!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings101Accept;I did it for my people. Truly.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings105;My guards rush in, hearing the commotion. They see me covered in blood, with the Amulet of Kings about my neck, and [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s corpse at my feet, asking me if I am alright. Their relief quickly turns to horror as they witness the Dragonfires - which burned brightly moments before - suddenly dissipate. My guards escort me out of the Temple and out of the City.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings105Accept;But the Dragonfires still burned, and the barriers are sealed.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings150Title;In Search of the Amulet;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings150;Driven my an uncanny inner purpose, I travel to Sancre Tor, the site where the ancient necropolis known as the Tomb of the Reman Emperors is said to be located. I only hope that I can find the Amulet of Kings still buried within...;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings150Accept;I must not fail!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings151;Just outside the ruins of Sancre Tor, I realize that I've been surrounded. A pack of hungry wolves circle around, closing in and snarling. I draw my weapon.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings151Accept;Die, beasts!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings152;Several of the creatures lurch forward and attack from different angles. I kill them one at a time, and more of the wolves attack me during the distraction. Eventually all of the attacking wolves are dead, with a few wounded stragglers retreating into the mountain brush. I make my way to the gates of Sancre Tor and enter.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings152Accept;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings155;As I comb through the dusty old hallways of Sancre Tor, I see a trio of heavily armored soldiers out of the corner of my eye. I ready myself for a fight, but one of them - seemingly their leader - raises [sancre_tor_blade.GetHerHis] hands in the air and speaks. "Stay your weapon, hero," [sancre_tor_blade.GetSheHe] demands. "My name is [sancre_tor_blade.GetFirstName]. The Grandmaster of our order, [sancre_tor_blade.Liege.GetFirstName], sent us to guard to Amulet of Kings, and to give it to you if you arrived here. Please follow us. We'll escort you to the Tomb of the Reman Emperors and unseal the wards used to protect the Amulet.";;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings155Accept;Lead on then.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings160;I follow the warriors through the stone corridors and several chambers until we reach the doors of tomb, covered in a glowing, magical seal. "Here it is," [sancre_tor_blade.GetFirstName] says. "Give us a few moments and we will drop the wards." After a brief ritual, the seal disappears, and I open the door. We walk past an array of stone sacrophagi, until [sancre_tor_blade.GetFirstName] stops me, pointing to one. "Reman III. The Amulet is still on his body. The warriors lift the top of the sarcophagus off, and sure enough, buried alongside an elaborately-decorated skeleton, is the Amulet of Kings!;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings160Accept;Incredible.;;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings165;I reach down and grab the Amulet, dusting it off and placing it around my neck. [sancre_tor_blade.GetFirstName] and the others look at me apprehensively, but when they notice the Amulet hanging firmly around my neck, they prostrate themselves before me. "Our [Root.GetEmpressEmperor]," they say in unison. [sancre_tor_blade.GetFirstName] looks up to me and makes a suggestion. "You should head to the Imperial City at once. Whether you are welcome there or not, it does not matter. You are truly Dragonborn. You must light the Dragonfires. And you must go - quickly!";;;;;;;;;x
AmuletOfKings165Accept;To the Imperial City!;;;;;;;;;x
