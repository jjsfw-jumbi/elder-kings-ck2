alliancewar.50.t;Alinor falls!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.50.d;The ancient city of Alinor, capital of the Summerset Isle and seat of Altmeri civilisation, fell to forces led by [Root.GetTitledName]! The city was reportedly looted, and countless artifacts dating back to the Merethic and First Era have been lost for all eternity.\nNews of the city's fall has reached the whole continent, and this will certainly strike a powerful blow against the Dominion's advances in Cyrodiil and the other provinces.;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.51.t;Wayrest falls!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.51.d;Wayrest, seat of the Royal Council and capital of the Daggerfall Covenant, fell earlier in the day to the forces led by [Root.GetTitledName]! The past decades have led to an incredible wealth influx into the province, even surpassing the ancient city of Daggerfall. As the Covenant is struck at its core, the Royal Family's whereabouts are unknown...\nThe Covenant might have to liberate its capital before it can claim any victory in Cyrodiil and against the other alliances.;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.52.t;Windhelm falls!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.52.d;Ancient capital of Skyrim, seat of the Palace of Kings, Windhelm fell earlier in the day to the forces of [Root.GetTitledName]! Founded by Ysgramor ages ago, the city suffered under the Kamal Invasion when the Queen of Skyrim and her heir were killed during the siege. But as King Jorunn and the leaders of Morrowind and Black Marsh united against a common enemy, Windhelm became one of the leading cities of the Ebonheart Pact.\nJorunn and his allies might have to liberate the city before they can claim any victory in Cyrodiil or the other alliances...;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.tbwOver;As the three Alliances vied for the control of Cyrodiil, only one could win the struggle and survive. It seems the gods favored [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick], [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Their victory over the other alliances and Cyrodiil gives them the opportunity to put in action their agenda over the Empire - be it conquest, liberation, or destruction.\nNo matter what they choose, their victory will be remembered for the centuries to come.\n\nThe Three Banners War is over, and Tamriel might finally now peace...;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.tbwOverOpt;Finally, peace?;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.100.t;The Pact triumphant!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.100.d;The Ebonheart Pact, an alliance between Eastern Skyrim, most of the Houses of Morrowind, and some of the Argonian tribes, was founded after the three armies defeated the Akaviri invaders, shortly before the start of the Alliance War. The goal of the Pact was to protect the independence of its members through the destruction of the Empire and all its claimants.\nThe Imperial armies and the pretenders have been defeated over and over again before we could declare total victory.\n\nNow the Empire is in our hands, and it is time to finish what we started when the Three Alliances War began.;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.100.optA;We will forever be free!;;;;;;;;;x

alliancewar.101.t;The Covenant triumphant!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.101.d;The Alliance War has ended with the Covenant, Emeric as its head, claiming the Ruby Throne! The alliance of Bretons, Redguards, and Orcs, a unique occurrence in the history of Tamriel which rose after the Reachmen invasion in the wake of the Three Banners War, proved to be too strong for the Empire and the other pretenders.\n\nThese three peoples can rejoice, as united they seem unstoppable.;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.101.optA;We are the sole legitimate Emperors of Cyrodiil.;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.102.t;The Dominion triumphant!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.102.d;The Three Banners War is over! The Dominion, led by the victorious Queen Ayrenn, has claimed the Ruby Throne. The pretenders have been crushed, their armies beaten by the supreme Aldmeri Forces and their Khajiiti Auxilia.\n The people of Tamriel can rejoice once again, the rightful and just rule of Mer restored to the White-Gold Tower.\n\nThis is the Dawn of a New Era, one of stability and prosperity, the Age of the Aldmeri.;;;;;;;;;x

alliancewar.103.d;While Tamriel held its breath, waiting to see which faction would win the Three Banners War, the impossible happened. The armies of the Dominion, the Covenant, and of the Pact were sent home as Cyrodiil won victory after victory. The alliances were forced to sign a peace treaty with Cyrodiil, swearing to never set foot in the Imperial City ever again. Some still claim that the Empire is nothing but a puppet for Molag Bal or other various Daedric forces, but in time they will be proven wrong.\n\nCyrodiil can breathe again and rejoice.;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.103.optA;Cyrodiil will never bow down to a foreign invader!;;;;;;;;;x
AllianceWar105Title;A Dominion Diminished?;;;;;;;;;x
AllianceWar105;The Aldmeri Dominion was founded with the promise that our people would share in the spoils of ruling the Empire, the realm of Man. Now the Empire is no more, yet here we remain under the Altmer yoke. How much of our blood has been spilled for nothing? How much more will be spilled for Altmer fantasies of power?;;;;;;;;;x
AllianceWar105OptA;Enough is enough! This 'Dominion' is through!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.110.t;The Dominion defeated!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.110.d;As the armies of the Aldmeri Dominion and the Empire of Cyrodiil clashed, it became clear that Queen Ayrenn's forces were outmatched. Earlier in the day, the Dominion was forced to sign a peace treaty with Cyrodiil, marking the end of the Dominion's attacks on the Empire.\n\nAs the Dominion retreats, the odds of Cyrodiil winning the war have never been so high...;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.110.dAlliance;[Root.GetFirstNameWithNick] already claimed Cyrodiil, but it didn't mean that the Three Banners War was over yet. Conflict with the other alliances continued, and it reached a breaking point today.\n\n[From.GetFirstNameWithNick] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has been forced to sign a peace treaty with [Root.GetFirstName] and leave the Seat of the Sundered Kings.\n\nIt seems [Root.GetFirstName] might be able to keep and protect Cyrodiil until [Root.GetSheHe] can proclaim a total victory...;;;;;;;;;x

alliancewar.111.t;The Pact pushed back!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.111.d;After months of fierce fighting in northern Cyrodiil, the armies of the Ebonheart Pact were pushed one last time. Today, King Jorunn was forced to sue for peace, officially ending his assaults on Cyrodiil.\n\nAs the Pact retreats, the odds of Cyrodiil winning the war have never been so high...;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.112.t;The Covenant retreats!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.112.d;The Breton, Redguard, and Orcish armies could not defeat those of the Empire. The Royal Council, having no other choice, officially ended the war with Cyrodiil, as victory seemed impossible. The Iliac Bay will take no further part in the Three Banners War.\n\nAs the Covenant retreats, the odds of Cyrodiil winning the war have never been so high...;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.115.t;Cyrodiil falls!;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.115.d;The Three Banners War was started over the Empire of Cyrodiil and the Imperial City. Each faction has already fought for months or even years for the Seat of the Sundered Kings, and today one of them can claim to be on the path to victory! [From.GetFirstNameWithNick] defeated the armies defending Cyrodiil, and claimed the Imperial Isle as [From.GetHerHis] own!\n\nThe conflict is not yet over. The other factions still need to be defeated, and peace has to be restored.;;;;;;;;;x
alliancewar.115.dFaction;While [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick] already claimed victory, [Root.GetHerHis] hopes of glory were shattered today when [Root.GetSheHe] was forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty with [From.GetFirstNameWithNick]. [Root.GetHerHisCap] faction has been forced to leave Cyrodiil, as troops from [From.GetFirstName] entered the Imperial City and secured most of the cities still free from occupying forces.\n[From.GetFirstName] now claims Cyrodiil as [From.GetHerHis] own!\n\nWhile the conflict draws to a close, there still are some rebellious forces denying [From.GetFirstName]'s claim on Cyrodiil and the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x
