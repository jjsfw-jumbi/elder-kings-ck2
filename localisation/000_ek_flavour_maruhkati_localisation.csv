### Events
maruhkati_flavour.1.t;The College of Selectives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maruhkati_flavour.1.d;During the Golden Age of the Alessian Order, our faith was guided by a small council of Selectives, led by the Arch-Prelate. When the Arch-Prelate died, the most pious of the Selectives was chosen to lead the faith and the faithful. After the fall of the Alessian Empire, our faith slowly lost ground to the worship of the Divines, up until the College of Selectives was left vacant and powerless due to the lack of any established clergy.\n\nBut with the reconquest of important centers of the faith, we can now sponsor the reconstruction of the College of Selectives, and ensure our faith will once again be led by an Arch-Prelate, chosen among the most pious Selectives of Tamriel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
