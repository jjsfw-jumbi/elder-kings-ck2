ekguilds70Acknowledge;Welcome home, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguilds75;After learning about my inheritance, I gave my formal resignation from active Guild work and returned home. I learned a lot during my time as a Guild member, and I hope that it has given me the experiences to be a better ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekguilds110Acknowledge;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguilds300Fighters;After returning from my latest successful assignment with the Fighters Guild, I received a sizeable reward of gold coins in recognition of my valor and skill-at-arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguilds300Mages;After returning from my latest successful assignment with the Mages Guild, I received a sizeable reward of gold coins to encourage further work in the name of the Mages Guild and its ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguilds300Acknowledge;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_fighters_supplies;Supply Run;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor101;The [Root.Society.GetName] needs some supplies delivered to another guild hall, and since I'm not busy at the moment, was asked if I could make the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor102;After a short journey, I arrive at the guild hall and drop off the much-needed supplies, and receive payment and thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor102Accept;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_fighters_shields;Shield-Making;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor105;One of the smiths working for the [Root.Society.GetName] has asked for my help in producing shields. A simple matter, but a time-consuming one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor106;I closely listen to the smith's instructions as we make each shield one-by-one. Though the work is tedious, she thanks me for my assistance and assures me that she'll put in a good word for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor106Accept;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor110;In addition to my financial compensation, the Guild has decided to award me with a valuable item from their armoury as a token of their appreciation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor110Acknowledge;Incredible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor115;Sparring with fellow fighters is an excellent way to hone my fighting skills. Though deaths in our arenas are rare, the duels are never easy, and sometimes quite bloody. Yet it's an exhilarating feeling, especially when I emerge victorious and hear my companions cheering me own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor115Accept;I am a gladiator!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor115Decline;It's great sport, but there are other things I'd rather do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor116;Fighting on horseback is a completely different art than fighting on foot, and I've taken to it exceptionally well. I believe I may have found my calling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor116Accept;I am an equestrian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor116Decline;Horsemanship is a skill, not a calling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor117A;Even great warriors are at a disadvantage when their equipment is broken and worn down. Fortunately for me, I have a natural skill at manufacturing and repairing arms and armour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor117B;Self-sufficiency is key to being a successful assassin. The necessity of repairing and replacing my equipment has helped me grasp the fundamentals of smithing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor117Accept;I am a blacksmith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor117Decline;It's a nice talent, but not my interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_fighters_bear;Unbearable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor120;Locals nearby are complaining about a bear that scavenges from their cesspit and is becoming increasingly bold around people. The [Root.Society.GetName] wants me to put the beast down before it hurts someone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor121;I journey to the hamlet and sure enough, the bear is wandering near some houses. I make a commotion to get its attention and it runs towards me. I draw my weapon and ready for battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor121Accept;For the [Root.Society.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor122;The bear is mighty, but I triumph over the beast with a fatal blow that kills the animal where it stands. With my task done, I make my return to the guild hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor122Accept;An excellent fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_fighters_zombie;Pure Dread;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor125;The [Root.Society.GetName] has asked me to put down a dread zombie that is wandering around a temple graveyard. No one has been harmed yet, but zombies tend to attack anything on sight so it's a matter of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor126;When I get to the cemetery, I smell the walking corpse before I see it - a fetid mass of green flesh shuffling about, gurgling and belching incoherently. I make haste in battling the fiend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor126Accept;For the [Root.Society.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor127;Vicious as it may be, the zombie is no match for me and I take the legs out from under the monster before decapitating it. A priest from the temple rushes outside and thanks me, and I travel back to the guild hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor127Accept;It was nothing. Really!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_fighters_merchant;The Bodyguard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor130;A merchant is transporting valuable goods overland and asked the [Root.Society.GetName] for an escort. The [Root.Society.GetName] has offered me the contract to protect him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor131;As I travel with the merchant along the roads, we are stopped by a small group of suspicious-looking armed vagabonds. "It's dangerous to be out here," one of them says. "Really dangerous." They draw their weapons - and so do I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor131Accept;Die, scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor132;The brigands rush forward and are ferocious foes, but I kill them, one by one. I look over my shoulder to see the merchant safe and sound. The rest of our journey is uneventful, and I receive the utmost gratitude for my assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor132Accept;You're welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor225;I just realised that Alchemy is a richly rewarding activity. With just a few simple ingredients and some patience, I can craft potions as powerful as any spells!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor225Accept;I am an Alchemist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor225Decline;Alchemy is fun, but I have other studies to focus on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_mages_restoration;The Pilgrims' Rest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor230;I have a prime opportunity to practice my Restoration magic. Numerous pilgrims are sick or injured from their dangerous overland journeys and have clubbed together to contract the [Root.Society.GetName] to tend to their wounds. I'm told that I can take the job if I wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor231;Using my knowledge of healing spells, I'm able to treat the maladies of my clients one at a time. Though some of their wounds will take additional time to heal, they still appreciate my effort and one even calls me a lifesaver. I take my payment and return to the guild hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor231Accept;It was no problem, really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor240;After countless time spent studying the methodology behind summoning and binding servants, I have garnered the knowledge necessary to properly reanimate and command the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor240Accept;I am a Necromancer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor320;I am busy cleaning old rubbish out of a run-down warehouse the [Root.Society.GetName] recently purchased and is in the process of renovating. Suddenly, I notice a small, glimmering object almost hidden among a pile of rags.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor320Accept;What's this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor325;Making money is exciting...it's even more exciting when I have to risk money to turn a profit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor325Accept;I am a gambler!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor325Decline;But gambling is wasteful. I'll save my funds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor330;Every so often, colleagues at the guild office need my help with improving designs for freight transports, even the freight itself. They tell me that I'm skilled at engineering, and in fact, I find it very enjoyable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor330Accept;I am an engineer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor330Decline;As fun as it can be, it's too stressful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_scenarist_singer;The Singer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor400;The [Root.Society.GetName] has been contracted to provide some musical entertainment at a gathering of landed gentry. I've been offered the job to run this assignment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor401;Everything is going well and our musical performance is well-received. At the end of the party, the host requests we perform last song to close, but one of the musicians has misplaced our songbook! I have to think of something for us to play, and fast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor401OptA;A soothing, classical instrumental.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor401OptB;A lively folk tune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor401OptC;A heart-wrenching ballad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor401OptD;A bawdy tavern song.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor405;I lead the rest of the band in performing a traditional instrumental arrangement. It does not offend the party goers, but no one seems to applaud or even notice our efforts! When we return, the guild commends me for at least thinking on my feet and salvaging the performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor405Acknowledge;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor410ScenaristA;The band follows my lead as we perform a rustic folk song. Those attending the party do not take kindly to our efforts, with one decrying our 'base peasant ditty' and the host politely requesting our departure from the event. The guild is most displeased at our failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor410ScenaristB;I have the band play a slow, sombre melody, which provides the backdrop to a sad song of lost romances. Those at the party consider it sad - not the song, but our efforts. A few mutter about the 'melodramatic tripe' and we are sent on our way shortly thereafter. The guild is most displeased at our failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor410ScenaristC;I lead the band in performing a tremendously ribald tavern song about promiscuous royalty, unfaithful lovers and their misadventures. Halfway through, someone throws a wine glass at one of my Guild-mates, knocking them unconscious and ending our performance. A booing crowd forces us to make a hasty retreat. The guild is most displeased at our failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor410Acknowledge;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor415ScenaristA;The band follows my lead as we perform a rustic folk song. The audience listens intently, as we regale them with verses about the peculiar lives of herdsmen and peasants. After we conclude our song, we receive a warm round of applause, and leave with commendation from our host. The guild is most pleased at our success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor415ScenaristB;I have the band play a slow, sombre melody, which provides the backdrop to a sad song of lost romances. As the party-goers listen, many of them weep a few tears, and a few who are familiar with the song eventually join in. We receive quite the applause after the song ends, and leave with commendation from our host. The guild is most pleased at our success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor415ScenaristC;I lead the band in performing a tremendously ribald tavern song about promiscuous royalty, unfaithful lovers and their misadventures. Many of those attending the party consider the song hilarious, with a few of the more intoxicated ones dancing along to the tune. We receive a wide round of applause after the song ends, and leave with commendation from our host. The guild is most pleased at our success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor415Acknowledge;Thank you! Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor420;With some of my free time at the Guild Hall, I thought it would be a fine idea to do some painting. And what a wonderful painting it is! I'm rather amazed at how well I captured the verdant greens of the rolling landscape and the delicate blue hue of the afternoon sky...I simply must find something to do with this painting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor420OptA;I shall keep it for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor420OptB;I will donate it to my local Guild Hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor420OptC;I know, I will give it to my spouse as a gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor420OptD;I'll sell it to the highest bidder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor425;My darling [From.GetHusbandWife] [From.GetFirstName] has given me a beautiful landscape painting that [From.GetSheHe] made with [From.GetHerHis] own hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor425Acknowledge;What a wonderful gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_scenarist_tour;Guided Tour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor430;Some tourists visiting [Root.Location.Capital.GetName] would like a tour of the settlement. I've been asked to guide them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431A;Over the course of the day, I lead the travelers through town, explaining the significance of various sites and districts. Before I can end the tour, several in the group ask if we can take a detour to go over some of the old monuments in [Root.Location.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431B;Over the course of the day, I lead the travelers through town, explaining the significance of various sites and districts. Before I can end the tour, several in the group ask if we can take a detour to visit the fortified garrison of [Root.Location.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431C;Over the course of the day, I lead the travelers through town, explaining the significance of various sites and districts. Before I can end the tour, several in the group ask if we can take a detour touring the markets of [Root.Location.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431D;Over the course of the day, I lead the travelers through town, explaining the significance of various sites and districts. Before I can end the tour, several in the group ask if we can take a detour and venture into the sewers underneath [Root.Location.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431E;Over the course of the day, I lead the travelers through town, explaining the significance of various sites and districts. Before I can end the tour, several in the group ask if we can take a detour to go over some of the shrines of [Root.Location.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431AcceptA;Of course. To the monuments we shall go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431AcceptB;Sure. But remember, do NOT agitate the guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431AcceptC;Please make sure not to buy stolen goods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431AcceptD;Into the seedy underbelly of [Root.Location.Capital.GetName] we go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor431AcceptE;Just make sure you respect the shrines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor432A;"And this, I remark as we visit one of the statuaries, "Is...actually I'm not really sure who this statue depicts." This is just the first of one of many mistakes I make as my attempt to complete this part of the tour goes awry. By the end of the affair, my party is less than pleased with my sub-par knowledge of the town.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor432B;As we journey into an armed encampment, the rowdy tour group gawks at the town guards, trying to converse with them and ask about the latest military news. This does not go over well and several of the tourists are arrested as spies. My insufficient knowledge of proper behaviour around military personnel leads the rest of the tour group to hastily disband.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor432C;At the town market, I escort the tour group as they buy some goods from a group of unusually charismatic merchants. After some time, they begin to talk with one another about how stalls in a nearby village were selling similar items for far less. They chide me for my lack of knowledge about the local markets and once the tour officially ends, are not at all happy at having been swindled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor432D;I lead the tour group into the sewers underneath town, but we cannot seem to find our way around at all, wading through muck and refuse only to wind up back where we started. The annoyed tourists ask me why I even bothered, and go their separate ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor432E;When we visit the shrines, my knowledge of who each shrine depicts are helpful, but my utter lack of understanding about style and symbolism about each shrine leaves the tourists unimpressed. They hastily leave as I continually demonstrate my lack of religious and metaphysical learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor432Accept;Confound it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor433A;I lead the tour group around a collection of statues and monuments honoring some of the town's local heroes. Each one has a story, a narrative, and I regale my clients with each, as they listen intently. Once the tour has concluded, they agree that they've learned a lot and reward me with a good bit of gold as reward for my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor433B;As we journey into an armed encampment, the rowdy tour group gawks at the town guards, trying to converse with them and ask about the latest military news. A few nearly get arrested as spies, but I jump in and talk the guards down, using my military knowledge to quickly build rapport with them - they sense that I too am a military [Root.GetManWoman] and allow us to leave unaccosted. The relieved tourists gift me some gold as thanks for my help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor433C;At the town market, I escort the tour group as they buy some goods from a group of unusually charismatic merchants. I quickly step in to help my clients, taking charge of the bartering and haggling to get the best possible deal from the merchants. The grateful tourists club together and give me a nice share of the gold that I saved them as thanks for my help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor433D;I lead the tour group into the sewers underneath town, and although the tunnels are dark and winding, we stumble upon hidden passageways and what appears to be an abandoned thieves' den, making it back to our starting point and with hardly any muck on our boots. Once the tour is done, the group gratefully gifts me some shiny gold coins for my efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor433E;When we visit the shrines, my knowledge of who each shrine depicts are helpful, and they are greatly impressed as I identify the stylistic and symbolic nuances of each construction. The tourists appreciate my dedication to the subject and, once the tour has concluded, leave me a tidy some of gold as thanks for my learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor433Accept;I hope this journey was enlightening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor450A;Great music can inspire so much emotion, and fill one with so much energy. And as luck would have it, I'm a natural at making great music! I wonder if I should spend more time performing songs and melodies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor450Accept;I am a musician!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor450Decline;I like playing music, but there are other things I'd rather do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor455;One of our most popular pastimes at the Guild Hall is to debate all sorts of philosophical matters. History, politics, current events, the arcane arts, military matters, fashion, and even food! I have found I have a real knack for convincing people to think about things the same way that I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekguildflavor460;Actions speak louder than words, and a painting is the culmination of days, months, or even years of action from an artist. With only a canvas, a brush and a few pigments, I can express thousands of emotions, swirling together in harmony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor460Accept;Painting is incredible! I must keep at this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor460Decline;As enjoyable as painting may be, there are other things I must do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor465;Why is magic so firmly associated with warfare, subterfuge and worship? Why not for entertainment? Dazzling candlelight and magelight, jump spells...there are so many possibilities to use magic just to make the world a little less dull!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor465Accept;I am a magician!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor465Decline;Fun perhaps, but I'll leave magic to the Guild mages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor505Greybeard;Deep in meditation, I reflect on Jurgen Windcaller's victory over the 17 Disputants. Though they wielded might, Jurgen wielded truth, and the truth of the Way of the Voice triumphed over all opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor505MothPriest;As I sit in solitude, I focus on the nature of the Elder Scrolls, and that while truth and falsehood are ever-present, the world of man needs from our order the former so that we can so dispense our knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor506Greybeard;In my meditation, I dwell upon the folly of the Dragon Cult, and the apogee of cruelty that it reached under the rule of Alduin and his Dragon Priests. Instead we must strive to follow Kyne's actions and act for the benefit of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor506MothPriest;Deep in thought, I consider the delicate balance within our order. How the novices depend on the elders for a path to understanding, how the elders depend on the novices to have their needs cared for, and that we must always look out for one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor507Greybeard;I think about the world that I've left behind to follow the Way of the Voice. The fanciful dalliances of physical passion are but a worthless obstacle to comprehending The Way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor507MothPriest;In my studies, I contemplate how frivolous the outside world is compared to this one. So many lives dominated by physical relationships, oblivious to the ephemeral, soul-filling beauty of the inner fabric of the world around them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor508Greybeard;I ponder about the Seven Years that Jurgen Windcaller spent developing the fundaments of the Way of the Voice. Not even hunger, one of the most primal needs, could cloud his focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor508MothPriest;Deep in meditation, I realise that physical nourishment is but a small fraction of what the all-encompassing nourishment of the mind can deliver. To focus on the former is to be deprived of the latter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor509Greybeard;As I meditate, I consider the errors made by the Tongues in the days of the First Empire. Though courageous and strong in will, their short-sightedness left their spiritual resolve wanting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor509MothPriest;In meditation, I dwell on the process that each Moth Priest must take to read an Elder Scroll. One must not rush. One must prepare. And one must prepare to prepare, every single day, that one may hope to unlock that which stands before and after us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor510Greybeard;My contemplation brings me to the reality that Greybeards have faced since the foundation of our order. Study of the Way of the Voice is neither simple nor easy, and takes an eternity of effort to perform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor510MothPriest;The rigors of reading an Elder Scroll enter into my mind as I meditate. Every step is a challenge that cannot be shirked, and likewise are our duties to provide for brothers and sisters in our order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor511Greybeard;As I meditate, I digest the nature of the dragons' greatest weakness. Their pride, overcoming all other senses, led them to defy the gods and impose an order that ultimately spurred their demise. Such pride must be avoided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor511MothPriest;Deep in meditation, I reflect on the flaw that is pride, and how it clouds our understanding of that which we read. Pride and preconception go hand-in-hand, and abandoning preconception is the first step into grasping true perception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor505Accept;Indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor525;My tireless study of the Voice is bearing fruit. I can sense that I have not only improved my ability to project many Shouts, but more importantly, I have attained a far greater understanding as to the inner meanings of each of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor525Accept;Su'um ahrk morah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.551.d;The greatness of a House can be measured by how its members treat everyone equally, and under the rule of law.\n\nIf we want [Root.GetGreatHouseSociety] to command respect, we must treat the others the same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.552.d;A Great House is only as strong as its members. As long as we do not fall, [Root.GetGreatHouseSociety] will stand.\nEven in the face of certain defeat we must keep our arm strong, and fight for the Temple, our House, and our family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.553.d;A House member that thinks themselves as better than the rest and already good enough will not learn new things. They will stagnate, and their House will stagnate.\nIf we want [Root.GetGreatHouseSociety] to stay in the front of Dunmer politics, we must always seek new knowledge, and accept that we still have much to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.554.d;The greatest threat for a Great House is having its members stay idle while the other act and gain influence.\nWe cannot let that happen, and every member needs to constantly work to ensure the House will thrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.555.d;Most other Great Houses are not above using treachery and plots to further their interests.\nBut if we want to be seen as a respectable House, one the common people can trust to protect them, we cannot use such low tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.556.d;The Tribunal watches over Morrowind, protecting us from outside invaders and granting us their infinite wisdom.\nOur duty is fist and foremost to honour them and the Temple, and only then can we protect our House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.557.d;If we are rash in our decisions and actions, we will miss bigger and better opportunities later on.\nIt is better to pass on a small advantage if by biding our time we could get a much better one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.558.d;[Root.GetGreatHouseSociety] only accepts the best, and everyone knows that. We do not tolerate the mediocre, and we have to make sure we aren't like them, less we lose what makes us much more important than them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.559.d;If we want to further the interests of our House, and our own, we must be ready to do all that's needed. No matter the means. No matter the costs.\nOnly then will our House thrive, and we will thrive with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.560.d;How could [Root.GetGreatHouseSociety] get more influence on the Council if we don't know what the othe Great Houses are up to? They will lie, they will cheat.\nWe have to be better than them in every way, including in the ways of treachery and plots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.561.d;Why should we let our rivals possess what we want? How can our House thrive if we let them get what they need?\nWhat is ours must stay in our House. And what is not ours must be taken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.562.d;The only truth in politics, both in the Great Council and in this very House, is that everyone seeks to further their interests and drag the others down. Some may be blind and naive, but we aren't.\nWe know that it's a cruel world out there, and in the end we are alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.563.d;We cannot rest. We cannot stop. Our House has great dreams, and only if we do too will we become stronger.\nOnly through unbridled ambition can we become the most powerful House on the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.564.d;Most Houses would destroy all influence they have if the Temple asked them to. While the Temple and the Three sit at the top, and rightfully so, we cannot let them dictate and control every aspect of our life.\nThe Gods do not see us as equals. Why should we rely on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.565.d;Influence, both in the House Council and outside, is built on one thing: Possessions. Either material possessions, like gold, potent artifacts, land or slaves, or immaterial ones, like knowledge.\nIf there's one thing we learned, it's to increase the influence we have. We cannot afford to give it away to our enemies, or waste it on irrelevant matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.566.d;There are those who will always want more. They will refuse what they think are meager gains, in the hope of getting something much better later on. And most of the time, they don't get anything at all.\nWe should be happy with what we can get. Limitless ambition will force us into more and more dangerous matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.567.d;The world is cruel. If we want to stay alive and thrive, we have to be cruel too. Naive individuals will be replaced by their betters, often at the cost of their life.\nIt is better to be cruel, than to suffer the whims of a cruel master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.568.d;In politics, one has to interact and meet new people. If one doesn't, their House fades away.\nWe must not shy away from new people, for they might be interesting opportunities for our House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.569.d;A House that does not take care of its children cannot stand. A House that does not take care of the people living in its cities cannot stand.\nMost other Houses forget this simple truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quest_thieves_theft;Theft for Hire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor600;An anonymous client has need of the [Root.Society.GetName]'s services and has offered us a contract. In turn, I've been offered the right to take the contract on as a guild job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor605A;The client has requested a priceless ruby necklace that is in the possession of a veteran adventurer. Surely they won't notice one small trinket missing? When I see my mark, they're wearing the necklace. Perhaps I can quickly snatch it without anyone noticing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor605B;The client needs some not-quite-legal merchandise moved overland. A simple task, as guards tend to leave most people alone. Near my destination, I drive the cart down the road and come to a stream where a few guards are stationed. I just need to act natural and I'm home free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor605C;The client has taken interest in a thoroughbred horse that isn't for sale. In the evening, I sneak into the horse's stables unnoticed and throw a saddle on the beast. Just as we exit the stables I notice few guards patrolling nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor605D;The client has a friend rotting in a village jail who needs to be freed post-haste. After I sneak into the destination, I see my target half asleep in a cell. The cell door is locked, but it can be picked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor605E;The client would like to acquire some quality attire from a tailor who is out of their price range. I visit the tailor's shop, carrying a pack full of counterfeit clothing that I will swap with the genuine articles before making a quick escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor605Accept;Alright...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610A;I attempt to snatch the jewelry off of the adventurer but he sees my hand out of the corner of his eye and holds on to the necklace with one of his own hands. We struggle with one another until several guards come rushing over, weapons drawn. I've been caught red-handed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610B;"Hold on there," says one of the guards. "Something about you isn't quite right. What have you got here?" The guard pulls up a cloth concealing a case of skooma. "Aha! We've got ourselves a smuggler!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610C;One of the guards looks up and sees me riding the horse. "Why, you're not the lord of this manor!" the guard exclaims. "What are YOU doing here?" Already-nervous but now startled, the horse throws me off its back as I tumble to the ground, surrounded by armed troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610D;I go through over a dozen lockpicks but the lock simply will not budge. I'm so absorbed into picking this lock that I don't notice the guards crowding around me. "STOP!" screams one of them. "The jailbreak's over, thief! Now you're the one who'll be behind bars!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610E;Quickly, I unpack the false clothes and switch them with the real merchandise, but I take a little too long and a clerk notices my actions. She calls for the guards, who rush into the shop and surround me, weapons drawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610OptA;Pay the court a fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610OptB;Serve my sentence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor611;I've just received word that [From.GetBestName] was involved in a legal dispute with some of the local guardsmen. [From.GetSheHe] paid a fine for the trouble, and I have received my share as rightful tax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor611Accept;How odd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor612;I've just received word that [From.GetBestName] was arrested for criminal activity by local guardsmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor612Accept;Lowlife scum...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor612Decline;I believe this is all a big misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor615A;I quickly pull the necklace straight off of the adventurer's neck. Bewildered, he looks around for the culprit but I'm already out of sight. I return with the necklace and present it to the [Root.Society.GetName] for my reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor615B;I keep my cool and none of the guards notice anything unusual. "A fine greeting to you!" one of the guards says as I wave back, smiling. Soon after, I reach the dropoff point and return back to the [Root.Society.GetName] den for payment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor615C;One of the guards recognises something is amiss but I manage to get the horse to break into a gallop as we quickly leave the manor compound, my face covered all the while. I take the horse to another stable where the client will pick it up and go to the [Root.Society.GetName] hall for my reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor615D;I quickly pick the lock, greet my rescue target and explain the situation. We sneak out of the jail and go to the [Root.Society.GetName] safe house where I am paid for a job well done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor615E;Quickly, I unpack the false clothes and switch them with the real merchandise, loading it into my pack and slipping out before the clerk working inside the shop notices me. I drop the merch off at the [Root.Society.GetName] den and get my payment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor615Accept;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor630A;Being a Thief doesn't just mean taking things. It also means breaking things - locks, doors, bindings, buildings, weapons, and more. I've noticed I have a real knack for doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor630B;Eliminating a target doesn't just mean using a weapon or spell. Sometimes loosening a stone, pulling a few nails out of a railing or sundering a support are far more effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor630Accept;I am a saboteur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor630Decline;It's a useful skill, but not my focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor635;The art of theft requires discretion. Taking someone's hard-earned gold or most prized possession isn't much use if someone catches me immediately after. That goes for hauling contraband too. Thankfully, my discretion is par excellence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor635Accept;I am a smuggler!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor635Decline;Smuggling might be profitable...but it's not really my thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EKGuildFlavor700B;The [Root.Society.GetName] has offered me a [Root.GetContractWrit] on a graveyard worker who steals from the recently deceased. This should be an easy job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor700C;The [Root.Society.GetName] has offered me a [Root.GetContractWrit] on a writer suspected of publishing libel. This should be an easy job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EKGuildFlavor700E;The [Root.Society.GetName] has offered me a [Root.GetContractWrit] on a dishonest merchant. She allegedly keeps guards so this might be a slightly challenging job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor700F;The [Root.Society.GetName] has offered me a [Root.GetContractWrit] on a skooma dealer on the run. Like most of his ilk he's probably armed so this might be a slightly challenging job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor700G;The [Root.Society.GetName] has offered me a [Root.GetContractWrit] on a bandit who murders people after robbing them. The bandit runs in a gang so this might be a dangerous job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor700H;The [Root.Society.GetName] has offered me a [Root.GetContractWrit] on a witch who lives deep in the wilderness. She's claimed to have skill in conjuration, so this might be a dangerous job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705A;I arrive at a hamlet wracked by horrid music and meet its creator. \n\n"Well met, friend!" the bard exclaims. "Have you come to soak in my serenade? Is it not a treat for your ears? You approach me so directly. How unusual in this town! Are you...a [Root.GetManWoman] of culture?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705B;I stop by a graveyard at night, where my target is already in the midst of his "work." The man sees me and stops in his tracks. \n\n"Whatever you think I'm trying to do, I'm not. I don't know anything, and I don't know you. You best be on your way back from where you came.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705C;I visit a modest country house and knock on the front door. The door opens up and a tired-looking woman stands before me. \n\n"Yes? What is it?" she asks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705D;On a lonely road, I am greeted by a merchant and his workers, whose wagon has broken down. "Please, do something about this fellow," the merchant pleads, pointing to the madman. "He threw himself on the road - we had to stop the cart and the front axle split in half. And he won't listen to reason!" I glance over at the maniac who's been spouting nonsense all the while. "Do you see the sky?!" the man says, pointing at a cloud. "Can you not recognise that your demise is laughing at you, ready to pounce on you?!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705E;I enter the merchant's warehouse where she - flanked by two guards - is taking inventory. At my appearance, the merchant and her guards notice me and turn about. The guards step in front of her and she frowns. "And just who are you supposed to be?" she snaps. "Can't you see that I'm busy, and you don't even bother to set up an appointment to speak to one of my clerks? You better have a good reason for being here.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705F;I enter a dim, dusty hovel where my target is said to be living. My entrance is greeted by a pathetic shriek emanating from a trembling figure. \n\n"Please don't kill me!" begs the man. "I'm not in the skooma business anymore! I told you all, I'm not going to even try selling to anyone again. Just...please, please let me go. Have mercy!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705G;A chance upon the bandit encampment, home to my target. All of the occupants draw their weapons to face me. \n\n"Oho, looks like we've got ourselves a hero!" says one of the group. My target, the enforcer, grins and raises a rusty axe. "Normally we have to catch our prey first," she says. "But this one's so charitable! I'll shed one tear when I split your gut open!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705H;Deep in the wilds, I visit a dilapidated hut and I discern a hunched-over figure with a clenched fist. Suddenly the figure turns around and unleashes a spell that summons a fetid, moaning zombie! The light from the spell reveals her wizened face. \n\n"I thought someone would be after me eventually. No matter. You made a mistake coming all the way out here.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor720;Upon returning to the [Root.Society.GetName] hall, I receive my payment and recognition of my skill as an assassin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EKGuildFlavor510Ansei;I find myself training daily alongside my brothers and sister in our quest for mastery of Hel Shen She Ru, the Way of the Sword. Progress is slow, but if we let our discipline waver we will never attain our goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor801Ansei;When Ansei of old wandered the land, they would right wrongs and help the citizinry in the name of virtue. It was this adherence to our code of Honour that helped them muster the discipline needed to master the Way. We should strive to be as just as they were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor450B;While most associate the Sword-Singers with our mastery of the Sword, our predecessors were artists and artisans before they picked up their blades. Lately, I have found myself more in tune with them as I have become engrossed in the study of several forms of music. I wonder if I should continue with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKAnsei100;Lately, I find my mind wandering more and more to the tales of the Hel Ansei of generations past and their mastery of the Shehai Shen She Ru. In this day and age, a select few of the most dedicated individuals can form their Shehai as a pale, ephemeral object, sometimes not even resembling a sword at all. However, in ancient times there were Sword-Saints whose Spirit Blades could cut through men like a scythe through wheat. Legends speak of Ansei of the First Rank undergoing a grueling trial to attain the Second Rank. If I dig enough, I might find enough information to recreate such a trial, and if I succeed, the secrets of the Shehai would be lost no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EKAnsei101;My search for information on the trail Ansei undertook to reach the Second Rank has taken me to the ruins of an ancient Yokudan fortress nestled in the mountains of Hammerfell. As I push open the doors leading to the antechamber, I am greeted by dust and silence that has not been disturbed for centuries. I make my way deeper into the citadel, wary of structures that could succumb to the burden of time and crush me. Finally, in a small chamber likely reserved for the Yokeda, I find what I am looking for. Though it might be written in an archaic form of Yoku, the studies I pursued alongside my training will help me overcome this obstacle with relative ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKAnsei101OPT;Now, for the actual trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKAnsei102;My search for information on the trail Ansei undertook to reach the Second Rank has taken me to the ruins of an ancient Yokudan fortress nestled in the mountains of Hammerfell.

Alas, it is written in an ancient form of Yoku that I do not understand, but I have not come this far to just give up. I shall remain here until I can make sense of the writings. My dedication shall not waver.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKAnsei102OPT;This might take some time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKAnsei103;For the trial I had to leave behind my arms and armour, so I did. After days of wandering through scorching heat, I happen upon a small hamlet just beyond the sands. As I refill my waterbags, an alarm sounds. A figure clad in black, surrounded by the walking dead, approaches. I take from the villagers the best blade they have. It is rusted, unbalanced, but with it I cut down many zombies. Then, the brawniest undead yet stands before me. He swings his sword at me, and my blade shatters, breaking in my hands. The brute prepares another swing. As I consign myself to my fate, the thrill of the fight, so familiar a feeling, melts away. In that moment of calm, I reach out to the Shehai, and behold, it is alive, alight with power. The necromancer and his band fall before me. The villagers, awestruck, offer me their thanks, but I refuse. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Before I can reach the shore, however, I am ambushed by a group of Dunerippers! I grab a sturdy looking piece of wood and do my best to fend them off, but I am hopelessly outmatched. One of the creatures shatters my makeshift weapon with ease. As a last-ditch effort, I reach out to my Shehai. As it forms in my hand, it takes on the shapeless shape as always.

EKAnsei105;Now that the secrets of the Shehai Shen She Ru have been rediscovered, the path to mastery is clear for all Sword Singers to see. However, that does not mean that walking it will be easier for me than it was for my predecessors - unlocking the true form of the Spirit Sword will require me to put my life at risk. But I am dedicated to see it through,  and with the guidance of the Hel Ansei no Shira, I will succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It cuts through the Dunerippers with ease, and before long I stand triumphant. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EKAnsei107OPT;I shall try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EKAnseiGlobalOPT;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor802;My dedicated towards mastering the Hel Shen She Ru has borne fruit. Not only am I becoming faster, stronger, but thanks to my tireless study of the Book of Rings and relentless training regiment, I understand the spirit of the sword itself on a deeper level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekguildflavor.90.d;My last mission for the [Root.Society.GetName] was barely a success. I fulfilled my task, but got seriously wounded in the process. I should take the time to rest, as I will certainly be permanently feeling the results of these wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.90.optA;This might have been a bit too much for my skills...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekguildflavor.92.optA;If only every mission could be like this one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.93.d;Despite my best attempts, my mission for the [Root.Society.GetName] can only be described as an utter failure. The clients are disappointed, and made it clear that I wasn't good enough for the task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.93.optA;Shame overtakes me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.94.d;Through great work and skill, I masterfully took care of the task the [Root.Society.GetName] assigned to me. I can feel proud, for our clients will be happy, and a happy client pays generously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

## Fighters
# Trivial
EKGuildFlavor101A;The [Root.Society.GetName] needs some supplies delivered to another guild hall, and since I'm not busy at the moment, was asked if I could make the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor101B;My brothers and sisters at the [Root.Society.GetName] have their armour in poor condition after a recent successful quest. They asked me to take care of it, as they need time to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor102A;After a short journey, I arrive at the guild hall and drop off the much-needed supplies, and receive payment and thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor102B;After a day of hard work, the armour of my companions is in much better condition, ready to be tested again in another mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Easy
EKGuildFlavor103A;A village near my local chapter of the [Root.Society.GetName] has asked us to put down a rabid animal that is threatening them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor103B;We have received reports about a local drunkard that has been increasingly aggressive over the last couple of days. The local guard claims to have more important matters to attend to, so a shopkeeper has asked us to take care of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor103C;We've received word from the local temple, it seems an undead has breached their holy ground. I was tasked to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor104A;I arrived at the nearby farm, and the owners have pointed me to the rabid animal. It is a [Root.GetLocalWildLifeI], that indeed seems sick and very aggressive. It seems to be in very poor condition, probably the result of a recent fight with another [Root.GetLocalWildLifeI].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor104B;The shopkeeper who asked for us received me when I arrived at his shop, and told me where the drunkard was seen for the last time. Killing them is obviously out of my options, I just need to straighten them a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor104C;The priest opened the temple door to me, and took me to a small room, where he managed to isolate the [Root.GetLocalLowUndead]. I now have to send it back where it belongs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Medium
EKGuildFlavor105A;A nearby town has tasked us with clearing a den of wild animals. They preyed on the inhabitants livestock, and one of them has even been attacked. The animals are getting braver by the day, and the town fears for their safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor105B;Bandits have been preying on the roads near our [Root.Society.GetName] chapter, and someone has to put them down. That someone seems to be me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor105C;A nearby village lives in terror ever since a couple of undead have been spotted nearby. I have been tasked with taking care of them, before the terror spreads to other villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor105D;A powerful beast has been sighted in a nearby village, and its inhabitants have asked us to take care of it. Make it flee the province, or kill it, they don't care as long as they can be safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor106A;I arrive at the [Root.GetLocalWildLifeI] den, and their pack seems smaller than what was reported. I have to act quickly, putting down the animals already there, and setting traps for those who aren't there yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor106B;I disguised myself as a travelling merchant, and travelled until the bandits ambushed me. They seemed surprised when they saw me drawing my weapon, but they charged at me regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor106C;The smell and clacking sounds have made the [Root.GetLocalLowUndead] easy to track and find. They mindlessly guard a small shrine, perhaps source of their power or of their necromancer's. Whatever it is, I have to put the undead to rest and destroy the shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor106D;The village pointed me to the last place they saw the [Root.GetLocalWildLifeII], and I immediately went to track the village's source of anguish. The fight will be tough, but what I learned with my brothers and sisters should help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Hard
EKGuildFlavor107A;A nearby town mage reported sighting a couple of magical beasts in the nearby forest. What force summoned them here is unknown, but they are still a threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor107B;A nearby town has been attacked by a bold group of bandits. The local watch managed to fight them back, but they fear the bandits will try again soon. They asked me to preemptively clear their hideout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor108A;The [Root.GetLocalMagicialWildLife] were not hard to find, as not many magical beings live in these lands. They are beautiful in their own terrifying way, but I still have to send them back where they come from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor108B;The bandits preying on the local town were easy to find. I took care without difficulty of their watchman, but I still have to fight a good dozen of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Very hard
EKGuildFlavor109A;A nearby city has sent disturbing reports of vampire activity. The city watch is clearly ill-equipped against such beasts, and they asked us to take care of it for them. I have to be careful, as I could become a vampire myself if it manages to wound me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor109B;A nearby city claims a werebeast has been preying on them, and there seems to be some truth to their claim. A lycanthrope is too dangerous for their watch to handle, so they contacted the [Root.Society.GetName] to take care of it. I have to be careful, as I could get infected with the same curse if the werebeast wounds me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor109C;Reports of activity in a nearby Tomb have started to arrive. A quick inspection of the Tomb showed that undead were starting to wake up, and become more aggressive for each passing day. We have to investigate the Tomb, and see who, or what, is waking the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor110A;I had to track the vampire at night, and I finally found where the beast live. It is awake and ready to fight, but it doesn't seem to have spotted me yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor110B;It was easy to track the [Root.GetLocalWerebeast], as I just had to follow the track carcasses up until a small cave. As soon as I am spotted, the cursed man turns back into his beastform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor110C;The [Root.GetLocalLowUndead] were easy to dispatch, but a terrifying surprise awaited us in the main chamber. A [Root.GetLocalPowerfulUndead] of old had woken up, and was using its lower undead to clear the Tomb and accrue its power. We have to take it down, now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Forging
forging_quest;A good blacksmith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor111A;The [Root.Society.GetName] has seen an influx of new recruits lately, some of which aren't properly equipped. Most of them have been given decent gear, but the other have been left with nothing. Crafting some [Root.GetTrivialForgingMaterialArmor] armours and [Root.GetTrivialForgingMaterialWeapon] weapons will do, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor111B;Some warriors at the [Root.Society.GetName] have asked for better equipment, now that they have to face more dangerous threats. Crafting some [Root.GetEasyForgingMaterialArmor] armours and [Root.GetEasyForgingMaterialWeapon] weapons will do, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor111C;Now that my local chapter of the [Root.Society.GetName] has to handle more dangerous tasks, our current equipment isn't enough. Crafting some [Root.GetMediumForgingMaterialArmor] armours and [Root.GetMediumForgingMaterialWeapon] weapons will do, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor111D;Elite warriors of the [Root.Society.GetName] have asked for some of the best equipment available. Crafting some [Root.GetHardForgingMaterialArmor] armours and [Root.GetHardForgingMaterialWeapon] weapons will do, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor111E;One mythic member of the [Root.Society.GetName] has asked for me personally. His old armour doesn't fit anymore, and they need something only I am able to craft. Crafting some [Root.GetVeryHardForgingMaterialArmor] armours and [Root.GetVeryHardForgingMaterialWeapon] weapons will do, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.112.d;I have spent the entire day collecting the materials needed for my new request, and I am now ready to get to work. The quantity and quality of the equipment I'm asked to forge and craft will make it difficult, but I could learn a lot from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
## Mages
# Trivial
EKGuildFlavor201A;The [Root.Society.GetName] needs some supplies delivered to another guild hall, and since I'm not busy at the moment, was asked if I could make the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor201B;As mages, we tend to use a lot of enchanted equipment, mainly robes, rings and necklaces. As they deplete over time, they need to be recharged once in a while. A batch of equipment to recharge has arrived today, and I was asked to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor202A;After a short journey, I arrive at the guild hall and drop off the much-needed supplies, and receive payment and thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor202B;I spent all day recharging the enchantments on various pieces of equipment. My brothers and sisters are now ready to face whatever mission they have next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Easy
EKGuildFlavor203A;A couple of students in the school of Restoration have arrived in our guild hall. I was asked to teach them the basics, such as healing a light wound, or maintain a magical barrier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor203B;A couple of students in the school of Destruction have arrived in our guild hall. I was asked to teach them the basics, such as conjuring a small bolt of fire, or depleting a target's health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor203C;A couple of students in the school of Alteration have arrived in our guild hall. I was asked to teach them the basics, such conjuring a small hovering light, or hardening their skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor203D;A couple of students in the school of Illusion have arrived in our guild hall. I was asked to teach them the basics, such as calming a target, or bolstering a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor203E;A couple of students in the school of Conjuration have arrived in our guild hall. I was asked to teach them the basics, such as summoning a familiar or binding a small weapon from Oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor204A;I took the students to the local temple, where some wounded soldiers rest. I showed them how to heal a light wound, and then asked them to help the healers with the rest. Hopefully I have taught them well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor204B;As the students gathered around me, I showed them how to conjure the elements at their advantage, before asking them to do the same in the element of their choice. If I taught them properly, nobody should get hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor204C;I showed the students how to lightly alter their surroundings, and then one by one they had to replicate what I did. It should be enough for now, assuming I did teach them properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor204D;I showed the students how to lightly alter their surroundings, and then one by one they had to replicate what I did. It should be enough for now, assuming I did teach them properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor204E;I conjured both a Wolf familiar and a small dagger from seemingly nothing, before asking the students to do the same. Drawing the powers from Oblivion is dangerous, but on such a small scale, and assuming the proper precautions have been taken, we should be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Medium
EKGuildFlavor205A;A good way to bring money to our local chapter is to offer enchantment services to whoever needs it. A travelling adventurer wants to strengthen his armour, and the guild asked me to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor205B;A common problem among mages is that we don't always have the resources or knowledge to cast the spells we need at a given moment. Scrolls are powerful tools, and the guild needs a bunch of them. I was asked to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor206A;I took the piece of equipment, a Soul Gem, and went to the Enchanter Table of our Guild hall. Enchanting is difficult, but if done properly can be really powerful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor206B;Imbuing empty scrolls with magic is a quite difficult task, but is safe if done properly. I will have to draw some of my magical reserves and infuse them into the scroll as I write the runes needed to form the spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Hard
EKGuildFlavor207A;Our chapter retrieved a couple of unknown scrolls in a recent expedition. They asked me to try and decipher them. They could prove useful, either as potential tools, or just for future knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor207B;We received an piece of equipment from another guild, with a letter asking us to disenchant it, as they don't want unknown side effects when wearing it. Removing an enchantment without destroying the item is particularly difficult, so they asked me to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor208A;I brought the scrolls to my studying table, and brought the list of currently known magical effects from our guild library. It will take me a couple of days to identify the scrolls, assuming I can even do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor208B;The enchanting table has been cleared, and I can now start disenchanting the item. I have to be very careful, as any mistake could destroy the item and the equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Very Hard
EKGuildFlavor209A;A traveller arrived today, claiming to suffering from a Daedric curse. While most curses can be taken care of by priests, the holy men say it is too difficult for them, as they don't want to draw attention to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor209B;We retrieved a cursed item from a nearby ruin, with dozens of corpses surrounding it. We only had it for a couple days in our halls, but already some members of our chapter feel sick. We have to destroy it. As last resort, we could seal it away, but destroying it would be better for everyone involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor210A;I took the traveller with me, along with a couple of associated. We determined the nature of the curse, and are now ready to try and destroy it. It can be deadly for the curse wielder, but if done properly we should all be safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor210B;With a book detailing most known cursed items, I secluded myself to try and destroy this source of evil power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EKGuildFlavor211A;A young adventurer came to our chapter earlier in the day, asking for some [Root.GetAlchemyTrivial]. This could be an easy way to get into Alchemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor211B;A couple of adventurers arrived the other day, looking for [Root.GetAlchemyEasy]. As I have a little experience in alchemy and ingredients, I was asked to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor211C;As the town alchemist has left for a couple days, one of his contract has given to us instead. I was asked to brew some [Root.GetAlchemyMedium].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor211D;A travelling caravan has stopped by our chapter, looking for more exotic potions to sell on the roads. They were particularly interested in [Root.GetAlchemyHard].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor211E;A noble came to our chapter, asking for some [Root.GetAlchemyVeryHard]. What they plan to do with it is unknown, and frankly doesn't interest us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.212.d;I managed to find all the ingredients needed, both in our own reserves and among local merchants, and can now work on our contract.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
## Magistrates
# Trivial
EKGuildFlavor301A;Communication between our local chapter of the [Root.Society.GetName] and the one of a nearby town has been slow lately. I have been asked to travel there and make sure everything is okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor301B;My brothers and sisters are always on mission, meeting local business owners, important merchants and nobles. As such, it is important to make sure our records are up to date. The task falls on me today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor302A;With a light escort, I went to the neighboring guild chapter, and came back with some news, letters, and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor302B;Bookkeeping is not the most interesting of jobs, but it's important and someone has to do it. After a hard day of work, our operations should go more smoothly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Easy
EKGuildFlavor303A;Our guild has been interested in a local small shop for quite a while, and negotiations have been going on for a few days to arrange a deal. Today is supposed to be the day we officially sign it, and I am the one who'll do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor303B;Our guild is always looking for new businesses to open, and we think we have found the perfect spot for a new inn near our chapter. I have been tasked with sealing the deal to buy the small plot of land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor304A;With the papers in hand, I arrived at the small shop. Its owner welcomes me, and we soon begin to ratify the deal. A recent change of situation requires us however to keep negotiating, so it might not be as easy as I thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor304B;With a large pouch of gold, I meet the land owner and we discuss the deal. Other chapters and land owners are also interested, but the owner knows some of our members, so it should be easy enough to convince him to sell the land to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Medium
EKGuildFlavor305A;We recently set our eyes on a failing business, and think we could buy it, change some things, and turn it into a profitable enterprise. Its owner seems a bit stubborn however, so we'll need to convince him to sell us the shop before it's too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor305B;A man recently inherited some farm nearby, but he seems more interested in adventuring than farming. He wishes to sell us the land, and use the money to buy some equipment and join a party of like-minded individuals. The guild asked me to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor306A;I asked the shop owner to meet, and showed him the numbers and how we would be ready to invest in his business and turn it into a profit. He still doesn't seem convinced. I'll just have to be a bit creative...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor306B;We met the would-be adventurer with some associates, and tried to find a common ground for a few hours. We seem to go towards an agreement, but we still have to be convincing if we want to buy this farm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Hard
EKGuildFlavor307A;We met with the local city magistrate. Trade has been slowing down lately, and he asked us to find a way to boost it. We would of course take a share of the profits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor307B;A mine has recently opened near our town, and we received some reports claiming that the workers found traces of rare ore in it. We should buy the mine before the owner realizes how valuable it could be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor308A;We drew some plans with the magistrates, with strategic businesses, well-placed inns, and roads that are in poor shape. This should hopefully make our town a more attractive to merchants, travelers and investors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor308B;It was difficult to both make sure the mine had valuable ore while preventing the owner and other chapters to hear the news too. But we think we have been careful enough, and approached the mine owner with a reasonable deal, at least for a regular mine. We just have to hope the owner will agree to it before realizing the potential of the mine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Very Hard
EKGuildFlavor309A;We heard reports of a nearby province with some unrest problems. It had to face a recent siege, a bandit raid, and a failed harvest. Its owner pleaded us to pacify it, while not resorting to violence. Boosting local businesses, providing some aid, and bribing some officials should be enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor309B;A nearby lord approached us today, with plans to buy a castle owned by another family, in order to extend his domain. While such a request is unusual, it could still be a very profitable affair, assuming we manage to get the castle for him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor310A;I arrived at the nearby town, with some guard and members of the guild. The problems of the city are rather obvious. The river flowing nearby isn't used at all, farms aren't properly maintained, and businesses don't work with the land owners. We start to make some plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor310B;Buying a castle that has been part of a family for generations isn't easy, and we're having trouble with this one. But still, we should be able to find a common ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Engineer
EKGuildFlavor311A;A shopkeeper has asked for us today. His small business is in need of repair, but he doesn't have the funds or the workers. He asked us to take care of it, in exchange for a part of his profits for the next year. I was asked with supervising the repairs, and maybe learn a thing or two about engineering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor311B;A farmer outside the city asked us to repair his buildings, damaged in a recent storm. This would be costly, but he assured us he would be able to pay without issue. I was asked with supervising the repairs, and maybe learn a thing or two about engineering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor311C;The local chapter of another guild needs to expand, but they don't have the expertise or the connections to do it properly. They asked for our experience, in exchange for boosting our influence among their contracts. I was asked with supervising the repairs, and maybe learn a thing or two about engineering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor311D;The town magistrate asked for us today. The guard barracks are incredibly ill-suited for the guard, and need to be redone entirely. I was asked with supervising the repairs, and maybe learn a thing or two about engineering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor311E;A nearby noble asked us to supervise his workers, who work of maintaining a part of his castle. I was asked with supervising the repairs, and maybe learn a thing or two about engineering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor312;I met with the owner and the workers, and we began discussing the repairs, the funds, and our share. If we are quick enough, we should see the profits come in in the next few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

## Scenarists
# Trivial
EKGuildFlavor401A;Communication between our local chapter of the [Root.Society.GetName] and the one of a nearby town has been slow lately. I have been asked to travel there and make sure everything is okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor401B;An important part of our work is to compile every official writing, piece of art, song, painting, that we can get our hands on. We recently received a batch of documents to compile, and I was asked to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor402A;With a light escort, I went to the neighbouring guild chapter, and came back with some news, letters, and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor402B;It's hard, and frankly boring, work to spend a couple days making sure every document we have is properly registered. But it also is necessary, otherwise knowledge would be lost over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Easy
EKGuildFlavor403A;One of my fellow members of the [Root.Society.GetName] asked me to repair one of his instruments today, as he needs to be out of town for a couple days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor403B;Our local chapter had an influx of new members today, and I was asked to give them a quick history on our Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor404A;With the materials and blueprints at hand, I have more than enough to repair the musical instrument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor404B;I brought the new members with me, and offered them a tour of the chapter, explaining the history of the Guild in general, of this particular chapter, and of some of the other members.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Medium
EKGuildFlavor405A;Another member of the [Root.Society.GetName] asked me to assist them in a performance they have to perform in a neighbouring inn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor405B;Our chapter has received a request from a nearby settlement, asking us to teach some of their aspiring bards and singers how to play for a local dignitary tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor406A;With our talents combined, we are sure to impress the patrons of the inn tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor406B;The singers and bards already have rudimentary knowledge about their craft. But still, there are many things to improve, and so little time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Hard
EKGuildFlavor407A;Our chapter is full of inventing musicians. One of them recently crafted a new musical instrument, but needs us to try it out and report the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor407B;A nearby noble is celebrating their birthday in the coming week. We have been tasked to manage part of the festivities, and our chapter tasked me with supervising the operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor408A;The instrument in hand, my brethren and I all choose a nearby inn and prepare ourselves to try it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor408B;I just arrived at the noble's manor with a groupe of other members of our chapter, and we are now starting to prepare the upcoming festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Very Hard
EKGuildFlavor409A;Our craft is always in need of new talent and tools. I have had some ideas in the past few nights about what could be a new musical instrument...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor409B;A nearby important ruler asked the [Root.Society.GetName] to design a new statue of himself. While it is not very difficult in itself, this ruler has rather... Extravagant tastes. He might be hard to please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor410A;As I assemble my thoughts and ideas, I start to design this new instrument, and how it could potentially influence our guild and art in general... If it goes well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor410B;I just arrived at the nearby ruler demesne, with a small group of experienced artists. We will need a couple of days with other chapters from our guild and other professionals to make sure the statue is everything our employer required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Musician
EKGuildFlavor411A;A young lad asked for our help today. He's recently fallen in love with a young woman living near him, and needs help to write down what he feels in a song.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor411B;I have received a request from a neighbouring inn, which is in need of a singer and musician for tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor411C;A petty noble died recently, and we have been asked to perform at his funeral.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor411D;A noble arrived at our hall today, asking us to write him a song for his own musicians. New patrons are always something we're looking for, and I have been asked to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor411E;A neighbouring lord asked for us today. He will receive a foreign dignitary in the next couple of days, and he wants us to impress him by writing a song combining both our and the dignitary's culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor412;Me and a couple of other Scenarists have spent the whole day writing down ideas, catch phrases and what instruments we could use in our current request. Hopefully it'll please our client.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
## Thieves
# Trivial
EKGuildFlavor601A;Thieves' caches are critical, as they allow our agents to resupply on the run, and to travel without having to carry all their equipment - which would slow them down and attract unwanted attention. They need to be resupplied from time to time, and I was asked to do it, tonight. The guards have already been bribed, I have nothing to fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor601B;The nature of our activities makes keeping a clean "hall" difficult. But there are always things that need to be sorted, repaired, or just cleaned. This time, it's my turn to take care of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor602A;I dropped the supplies on various caches in town. I froze when a guard caught me, but he simply turned away, pretending to not have seen a thing. I'm lucky guards are so eager to take bribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor602B;It's much more interesting to go outside and do some actual work, but even thieves like to sleep in a proper bed and to have strong lockpicks. One of the more veteran members of our hall brought some mead from a neighbouring inn, and shared it with me while I was fixing one of our secret entrances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Easy
EKGuildFlavor603A;While on the run, it is vital to know what places are safe, dangerous, or just full of loot. To communicate that kind of information quickly, efficiently, and without drawing too much attention, we mark the buildings with Shadowmarks, easily noticeable by our agents on the field. They tend to be removed by the owners, or the nature of the building can change, so we have to update or replace them from time to time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor603B;Most merchants are too honest to buy stolen goods, and selling them valuable items that have just been stolen is often impossible. Luckily, we have fences in each major city, who are more than happy to take care of our stolen fortune. One of them hasn't responded to our messages for quite some time, and we need to know why.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor604A;I spent most of the night making sure every important building had Shadowmarks. One of these buildings, a former inn, has been bought by the local magistrate and turned into a guard barracks. Hopefully, the Shadowmark will prevent any other thieves to run into a guards barrack hoping to get some loot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor604B;I travelled to the small town our fence is supposed to live in. He wasn't hard to track down, and told he needed to lay low for a while, as the new guards weren't yet easily corrupted, and one batch of his goods had recently been seized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Medium
EKGuildFlavor605A;It seems a rather important business in town "forgot" to pay its protection tax recently. It would be a shame is something were to happen to the silver statue its owner holds in his house.\nA shame, really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor605B;Breaking in a shop and stealing some items or gold is a good way to make money, and to attract attention, as the owner quickly sees that stuff is missing. However, by forging the numbers in their books, we can delay that, and pretend nothing ever happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor606A;Even after meeting with the business owner, they refuse to pay what they owe, even insulting us and threatening to inform the guards of this "pathetic threat". At nightfall, I broke in, looking for this valuable item that should help us in our... negotiations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor606B;I arrived at shop that has recently been hit by one of our members. Its owner hasn't caught on what happened yet, and it would be best to keep it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Hard
EKGuildFlavor607A;Even though we are thieves, we don't like to let one of our own sleep in prison. Partly because we don't want the same to happen to us, and partly because if they talk, we could all go down. So I have been tasked with helping them break out, before they talk, or worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor607B;A nearby noble has angered one of our patrons the other day, and said patron wants to drag the noble in the dirt, destroy their reputation, and other wonderful things only we can do. A couple of us have been tasked with making sure the noble wouldn't even be able to get into town without being dragged to prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor608A;Thanks to a couple bribes and recalled favours, I managed to get in the prison. Now comes the most difficult part, locating my fellow thief, get him out of his cell, and walk back to the guild hall without getting caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor608B;I don't know what the noble did to our patron, but given the number and difficulty of the tasks at hand, they must have seriously pissed him off. But a job is a job, and we'll get paid in the end, assuming we don't screw up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Very Hard
EKGuildFlavor609A;Some folks around here seem to have forgotten who's actually pulling the strings. Along with other several members of the guild, we've decided to strike hard and fast. We've been listing important and valuable items all around the city, in all the shops, houses, official buildings, and even some temples, and are ready to strike everywhere at the same time. They won't know what's coming, and they won't be able to prove it was us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor609B;We have received word that a heavily guarded trading caravan will pass nearby in the next few days. While it is usually considered too dangerous, since we neither want to kill nor get killed, its shipment is said to be heavily valuable, and could set some of us for life. We'll have to strike fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610A;Every one of us has been assigned a building, with a target item to steal. We couldn't risk word getting out, so neither the guards nor the lower members are aware of what's going to happen. But soon enough, all town will realise that the [Root.Society.GetName] means business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor610B;I have my eyes on the caravan and its guards. As expected, it is heavily guarded, but we managed to get some of our members among them. They'll soon stop at an inn, and this should be our time to shine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Smuggling
EKGuildFlavor611A;Part of our job is to pass goods from town to town. Obviously illegal, potentially highly profitable, sometimes incredibly dangerous. But tonight, we only need to smuggle a couple [Root.GetTrivialGood] in a small town, with little to no guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor611B;War can be highly profitable. And even in peace time, all kinds of groups are in need of weapons. We have been asked to smuggle a couple of weapons and armors in town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor611C;A fence tipped us about the siege the city they're living in is going through. While their special status among the guild protects them from most harm, they still see an opportunity to gain the support from both the people of the city, and the local authorities. We just need to pass a large shipment of food and other supplies through the walls. While it could seem easy, we have an entire army guarding every entrance. Or at least, the entrances that they know of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor611D;Illegal substances are the perfect fit for a smuggler. Very high demand, a supply totally in hour hands, and even the local nobility and guard are into it. We recently got our hand on a batch of [Root.GetDrug], and we have hundreds, if not thousands, of potential buyers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor611E;Slave trafficking is highly lucrative, highly immoral, and potential incredibly illegal. While our connections tend to protect us most of the time, this is the kind of job the rest of the Guild can't afford to cover us for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor612;I got my hands on the shipment, whatever it is, a contact within the city, and a pocket full of gold should a guard pass by. Hopefully everything will go smoothly, and everyone - mostly our guild, will get richer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
## Assassins
# Trivial
EKGuildFlavor701A;Assassins use a wide variety of tools and equipment. Daggers, bows, poisons, battleaxes, magic, everything can be used to get to our target, slay them swiftly, and disappear. But these tools don't appear out of thin air, and we have to resupply our hall from time to time. This falls on me today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor701B;Through intense usage, falling from great heights, weapon impacts, or whatever can arise in our missions, our equipment tends to decay and is often in need of repair. We can't exactly ask regular blacksmiths to repair the weapon that might slit their throat one day, so we all learn the basics of forging. I have been asked to take care of the equipment of a fellow assassin who just got back from a successful mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor702A;I paid a little visit to our regular suppliers, made sure all the basics were covered, and brought it all to the guild hall. That should be enough for most of our members, and those who have very specific needs will have to wait for our specialists to arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor702B;I spent all my day repairing armour, sharpening daggers, cleaning poisons and sorting spellbooks. While this isn't the most interesting of jobs in a guild of assassins, this is one that needs to be done from time to time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Easy
EKGuildFlavor703A;We recently had a contract on a low-scale target, like a petty merchant or a commoner. While they usually are handled by only one assassin, this one seems a bit paranoid, and will need more time to be taken care of. I was asked to get some intel on our target, to ensure a swift and clean execution later on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor703B;As professional assassins, we can't let anything to luck. We must know our target, know its weaknesses, know how to get close, and know how to get away as fast as possible. We have over the years built some connections and bought some buildings to ensure that we can always get through the sewers or on the roofs, but we need to make sure it's still safe before a big hit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor704A;Our target was easy to spot, but indeed seems paranoid. They don't seem to have spotted me, but I still have to be careful while eavesdropping and following them home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor704B;I have a list of places to check and clear if needed, which will take me all over the city. While mostly safe, I still have to make sure no target can spot me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Medium
EKGuildFlavor705A;We received an unusual request today. We don't have to assassinate someone, but to only pretend to have killed them. It seems our "target" is actually on the list of hitmen we don't know of, and they are ready to pay a lot if we allow them to falsify their death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor705B;We have an important hit today, which requires a bit more coordination than usual. The assassin that has been assigned to the job cannot just walk in and slay the target, especially if we don't want the assassination to be too obvious. I have a small part in it, as I have to impersonate a guard, but we must all fulfil our part, otherwise the whole contract goes awry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor706A;The "target" has agreed to take part in a small show, where I would "assassinate" them in a place where the hitmen can see us, and won't dare to act - especially since we would essentially be doing their work for them. If everything goes right, the "target" should be out of sight, and town, in the next few hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor706B;I managed to find and assassinate a guard, and can now join the barracks with their equipment. For now, nobody noticed anything. I spot other members of my guild, hidden in plain sight, and I can feel we soon will make a move...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Hard
EKGuildFlavor707A;Assassinations don't always have to be obvious. Sometimes, it's better for everyone to think the target died of natural causes. Someone on our list is amateur of fine dishes, and we have an opportunity to replace their cook with me, where I could poison their meal and get away before the target can suspect anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor707B;Young assassins can sometimes be assigned a mentor for missions that might be out of their reach. I am assigned to a small group of young recruits, who will have to take care of someone before they are truly ready. As such, I am expected to take care of any threat their might encounter, ensure their safety, and cover for them if needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor708A;I managed to get into the target kitchen, their former cook lying in a pod somewhere. I have the poison in my pocket, and need to both put it without getting seen, and ensuring the target eats what I am cooking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor708B;The younger assassins are on the ground, while I am on the rooftops. I already took care of a couple guards who might have spotted the young recruits, and we are getting close to our target. If everything goes right, we'll be able to share a drink in a neighbouring inn. If not, we'll have to run and hide for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Very Hard
EKGuildFlavor709A;A recent contract required us to postpone the discovery of the target's death. To that end, I was asked to impersonate them for a few days. I will have to make sure nobody can see who I am, otherwise I'll have to flee really fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor709B;To strike in the heart of a province, we need to frame a noble for a murder they didn't commit. Picking a secondary target our noble is known to hate, forging documents, bribing "witnesses", all of these are potential tools that we'll need to use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor710A;I managed to infiltrate the target's entourage, and have mostly fooled them for a full day already - claiming to have fallen ill and to have requested a priest that owed us a favour. Only a few more days and I'll be able to disappear, along with our target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor710B;Me and other assassins took care of most of what was needed to frame our target, and everything should fall nicely as we predicted it. Assuming we did our job right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Assassinations
ASSASSIN_MISSION_TWO_CHECKS_CT;Assassinations quests can potentially have two phases.\nThe first is based on your §YIntrigue§!, and will check if you can kill your target in a single blow without getting seen.\nThe second phase, if you get caught, will check your §YPersonal Combat Skill§!. Here, a failed contract means death. But even if you manage to kill your target, you can get wounded, if not worse, during the fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor711A;I was awarded a contract recently. A local [Root.GetAssassinCommoner] is the target of the [Root.GetAssassinWrit]. What they did to invoke the wrath of [Root.GetAssassinDeity] doesn't matter, they have to die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor711B;I was awarded a contract recently. The target of the [Root.GetAssassinWrit] is hiding among a group of bandits, scum that both protects the target and won't be missed by anyone. If they stand in the way of the wrath of [Root.GetAssassinDeity], they have to die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor711C;I was awarded a contract recently. A petty noble seems to have been enough of a nuisance to deserve a meeting from me. The wrath of [Root.GetAssassinDeity] doesn't spare anyone, even the nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor711D;I was awarded a contract recently. A powerful individual, probably too big for regular assassins to handle. But our organisation, myself included, aren't regular assassins. The wrath of [Root.GetAssassinDeity] won't spare them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor711E;I was awarded a contract recently. Or rather, several. A high ranking individual wishes to quickly ascend among their peers, and for that they are ready to use our talents. Each target received its own [Root.GetAssassinWrit], to be fulfilled in both a specific order, and a short timeframe. The wrath of [Root.GetAssassinDeity] won't spare them because of their social rank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor712;I can clearly see my target. Whoever could stand between us has been taken care of, and for now they don't see to have noticed me... Let's keep it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKGuildFlavor713;Curses! I could not assassinate my target, as I have been noticed before delivering the killing blow. I will have to fight to both fulfil my contract, and to get out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
## Other missions and quests
# Fighters - Minor training
minor_training_quest;Training and sparring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.115.d;Greetings, [Root.GetSocietyRange] [Root.GetFirstName].\n\nWhile most of us would crave the dangerous expeditions to slay some famous beasts, sometimes it is better to just spend a couple of days with a brother or sister from the [Root.Society.GetName].\n[training_companion.GetFirstName] could also use some sparring, and we propose that the two of you meet, and exchange some friendly blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.117.d;I met with [training_companion.GetFirstName] in the training yard. We have a wide array of weapons and armors available, and while it could be a nice opportunity to train on a new weapon, maybe it could just be better to do some basic exercise and make sure to have a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.117.optA;We'll just take it easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MINOR_TRAINING_PHYSICAL_EXERCISE_CT;You will focus on having a friendly time with [training_companion.GetFirstName]. While it won't be nearly as useful as a more intense sparring session, it could be a way to alleviate your spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.117.optB;Let's put into practice some of the moves I learned recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekguildflavor.118.d;The past few days have been surprisingly pleasant. Spending some time with [training_companion.GetFirstName], talking about our current lives and relationships while exchanging friendly blows really lifted our spirits. It may not have been the most effective way to train, but I feel better, both in body and mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.118.optA;I feel great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
minor_fighter_training_health;Friendly sparring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
minor_fighter_training_health_desc;[Root.GetFirstName] spent a couple of days with a friend from their guild, exercising and having a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekguildflavor.119.d;After spending some days training with [training_companion.GetFirstName], I already feel more confident with my weapons. It has been tiring, and I can feel my muscles and bones hurt after all this sparring and fighting, but it was still very beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
minor_fighter_training_practice;Sparring partner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
minor_fighter_training_practice_desc;[Root.GetFirstName] trained for a handful of days with another member of their guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
