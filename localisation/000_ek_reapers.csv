Furthermore, the condition is reported irreversible as well as incurable, and the scattered records of the events are worrisome. With no source of evil revealed people are turning to their gods and on each other, to protect themselves from contagion. Many call it similar to the Flu, but far worse...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10003;We have received news of a horrible epidemic in [plague_outbreak_location.GetName], part of [plague_outbreak_location.Realm.GetName]. At first the rumors were thought to be exaggerated, but ever since the disorderly arrival of inconsolable refugees at our gates, it has been difficult to ignore what is happening. They tell of various symptoms, and our couriers from the area report seeing people covered head to toe in a single red rash, coughing endlessly, while others have blood ooze from the eyes, nose and mouth.

Dread is spreading, seeping into the heart of the realm while our healers are at a loss - there is no cure to the horror wreaking havoc among the populace. The cause of the disease is unknown and those trying to protect themselves are left to their own devices. Bodies are piling up, a mix bright red from the rashes and dark red from dried blood...

EVTDESC_RIP_10015;Knahaten Flu has spread throughout Argonia, annihilating the entire region's non-Argonian populace. Man, Mer and Beast alike are dying by the thousands as their corpses collapse into the fetid swamps and waterways. The Argonians are scrambling to make sense of the death that surrounds them. Non-Argonian villages in the marshlands have become ghost towns, some bereft of even a single inhabitant.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10016;Trade routes across Tamriel are suddenly losing much of their business, and the reason is known - word is coming in that Elsweyr and its great cities have been swept by the Knahaten Flu. As bloodied corpses fill the once-busy streets of the sprawling Khajiiti cities, horrified officials have turned to razing whole neighborhoods in an effort to stop the spread of disease.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10017;An ominous shadow looms over Morrowind as Knahaten Flu has left little but tragedy in its wake. Even the largest of Morrowind's ancient Dunmer families are barely clinging to existence as casualties pile up. Worshippers of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] pack the temples, seeking healing and wondering why something so terrible would ever be allowed to happen.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10018;Death is haunting Cyrodiil, the land of the Imperials. The densely-packed cities that were once considered beacons of civilisation have transformed into death traps filled with rotting, diseased corpses.

EVTDESC_RIP_10019;Skyrim, a land famous for being home to the proud and hardy Nords, has given in to despair as the agonizing effects of Knahaten Flu spread throughout the region.

EVTDESC_RIP_10020;Death comes to all, and in High Rock, this has become all too true as the land plays host to the dreaded Knahaten Flu. Commoners and nobles alike are perishing in record numbers and the once-lucrative Iliac Bay is now the escape route of choice for hundreds of jam-packed refugee vessels. Even the greatest of the region's questing and crusading Breton heroes are at a loss for how to alleviate their people's suffering.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10021;Panic is rising as Knahaten Flu destroys the lives of victims across Hammerfell. As the streets of its glimmering cities run red with blood, bands of terrified Redguards and other residents are retreating into hastily-planned camps in the mountains and desert sands, hoping to wait out the epidemic by avoiding its wrath. Time will tell if such plans will work, but reports are that even many of these camps are falling victim to Knahaten Flu.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10022;Cries ring out in the forests of Valenwood. Knahaten Flu stalks beneath the canopy and creeps in the highest tree branches, like an inescapable predator with an insatiable appetite. No matter where the Bosmer, Imga and other tree-climbers flee, the ravages of Knahaten Flu follow, and the underbrush is stained from the blood of dead bodies.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10023;Not even the isolationist ways of the Altmer could protect their islands - Knahaten Flu has reached the shores of Alinor and decimated the populace. Mages all over the islands are attempting to mitigate the Knahaten Flu's damage and save the ailing populace, but their efforts seem to be in vain as many are falling ill, themselves.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_10024;No one is safe as the Knahaten Flu claims victims in Pyandonea. Temples to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] are filled with writhing worshippers, many bleeding out from the disease as they cry out to overwhelmed priests in efforts to find healing. The rapid deaths of Maormer Snake-Mages has caused the Elves to lose control of their once-loyal sea serpents, many of which now stalk the jungles and waterways and prey on unwary refugees.;;;;;;;;;x
EKRip75Desc;From the Meratsies River Valley all the way to the Topara Valley, Knahaten Flu terrorizes the people of Tsaesci. As blood flows from their eyes, noses and mouths, the blood-drinking Tsaesci believe their sources of nourishment to have been poisoned. Conspiracy theories run rampant and the butcher shops and kitchens that produce blood for public consumption have been torched, but it has been of little use in stopping the epidemic.;;;;;;;;;x
EKRip76Desc;Even the wind-swept tundras of Kamal cannot stop the merciless march of the Knahaten Flu. Pockets of smoke can be seen rising over the horizon no matter which direction one faces - the tell-tale sign of countless funeral pyres constructed to destroy the rotting bodies of unfortunate victims. What little trade took place here has completely halted, as frightened survivors hide themselves in remote lodges and ice-covered strongholds.;;;;;;;;;x
EKRip77Desc;The Thousand Monkey Islands, full of once-busy cities and formerly host to lively festivals, have fallen to panic and desperation. Seaside villages have shuttered their ports in vain hopes of slowing the spread of disease, leaving many Tang Mo city-dwellers trapped on islands where Knahaten Flu is destroying nearly everything it touches.;;;;;;;;;x
EKRip78Desc;A deathly cloud hangs over the sandy homeland of the Po Tun. In spite of the talents of their finest healers and wizards, thousands of Po Tun residents have perished from Knahaten Flu. Their corpses, rapidly piling up in the streets, bake under the scorching desert sun. The resulting stench permeates every rock-hewn city and is driving refugees into the inhospitable deserts and badlands.;;;;;;;;;x
EKRip79Desc;Knahaten Flu is mercilessly sweeping into the Quey Islands. Ships full of dead bodies idly drift into its bays and ports, greeting horrified townspeople with the promise of infection and almost certain doom. Quey Islanders can neither identify a reliable cause nor cure for the epidemic, and many have given up their seafaring lives and retreated inland to the forested hills where they believe exposure to the disease is less likely.;;;;;;;;;x
EKRip80Desc;The cold hand of death, more frigid than even the most frozen reaches of Atmora itself, grips the Northern Continent. Whole villages of Atmorans have perished to Knahaten Flu, their bloody bodies quickly buried under the endless snowstorms. The largest settlements have turned to self-quarantine, with weeping men, women and children wandering out into the wilds to die, perishing by exposure to the elements in hopes of protecting their families from infection.;;;;;;;;;x
EKRip81Desc;Roscrea's brisk air, once dominated by the smell of rendered whale carcasses, now stinks of the mounting casualties inflicted by Knahaten Flu. Whalers and fishers alike are taking to their boats, even tiny skiffs, and heading out to sea with the notion that they can wait out the epidemic. Those stuck on land are less fortunate, with the death toll rising sharply day by day.;;;;;;;;;x
EKRip82Desc;Disaster strikes Yokuda, the Sunken Continent. Knahaten Flu has reached the shores of its many islands, and the formerly busy trade ports are at a standstill as panicking Yokudan merchants, sailors and townspeople crowd the many temples in desperate hopes of finding healing. The local priests, despite their best efforts, can do little to stem the tide of the Knahaten Flu.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RIP_13001;Word is going around that since the epidemic came to [capital.GetName] we have seen an increase in cats. Our people are sure the cats are in fact Khajiit spies, who are helping spread the disease.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_RIP_13002;Keep some for observation.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_13003;Complaints about the cats will not end, and an angry mob has gathered claiming that some of the cats must be Khajiit agents, and that they have proof.
