### Decisions
proclaim_ald_cyrod;Proclaim Ald Cyrod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
proclaim_ald_cyrod_desc;Ever since Alessia and her horde of slaves took control of Cyrodiil, and her heirs expelled or killed all the remaining Ayleids lords of Cyrod, we have had to hide, mostly in Valenwood or in High Rock. Should the Imperials lose their grasp on our rightful land, we should try to retake control of what was ours, and proclaim Ald Cyrod once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PROCLAIM_ALD_CYROD_EVENT_CT;You will proclaim to the world that the Ayleid are the sole masters of Ald-Cyrod. Your descendants will be remembered as part of a glorious bloodline from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ayleid_flavour.10.t;The Wild Elves rise again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayleid_flavour.10.d;Millenia ago, our glorious race controlled a vast Empire with Cyrod at its center. Our culture prospered, and each city state was a power in its own right. But all came to an halt when the Nedic slaves rebelled against us, and slaughtered us. We were cast out of Cyrodiil, and had to seek refuge in Valenwood or within the Direnni Hegemony. But today marks the dawn of a new age for the Ayleid ! Ald-Cyrod is firmly under our control, and our race is once again welcome in the Starry Heart of Nirn!\n\nTamriel has changed. The races of Men have had their time, and the Ayleid rise once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayleid_flavour.10.optA;We will never kneel again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayleid_flavour.11.d;In a striking blow against the races of Men, a force of Ayleid landed in Cyrodiil years ago. Ever since, their hold on Cyrodiil grew, and today marks the official proclamation of "Ald-Cyrod". It seems Tamriel sees a new Ayleid hegemon. Will it stand the test of time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayleid_flavour.11.optA;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### Events
ayleid_flavour.1.t;White Gold falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayleid_flavour.1.d;The Imperial City, heart of Cyrodiil and most of the Empires of Tamriel, was controlled by the races of Men for centuries, ever since Alessia, Slave-Queen of the Nedes, led a rebellion over her Ayleids overlords. Since then, the Ayleid influence and power over Cyrodiil grew smaller and smaller, until all traces of the Ayleid rule over the province were erased.\n\nBut it is over now! [Root.GetTitledName] launched a successful invasion of the Imperial City, and rules the heart of Cyrod, ready to take back what was once the realm of the Ayleids!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayleid_flavour.1.optA;Cyrod will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
