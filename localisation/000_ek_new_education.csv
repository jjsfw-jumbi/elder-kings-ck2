EVTDESCD_ZE_13031;When I play, I do best when I trust my instincts. It's okay to think, just not to think too much. That slows me down.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13031;I will seize the day!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_13032;Young [From.GetFirstName] does not care in the least about the consequences of [From.GetHerHis] actions.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_13034;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tells me that there are consequences to everything that I do, and I need to think about this seriously.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_ZE_13034;Ha, as if!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_13051;I've learned that when I want to get something done, I need to do it myself. And trying to play nice is the surest way to fail. Now I know the ends justify the means.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13051;Stay out of my way.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_13052;I've noticed that young [From.GetFirstName] is so cold and severe.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_ZE_13054;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is a naive fool!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_13061;What they never tell you about those questing heroes who wander the world is that they're always covered in dirt, and blood, and ew! - who knows what else. They're just filthy!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13061;Whereas I shall strive to look my best!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_13062;Young [From.GetFirstName] surrounds [From.GetHerHim]self with finery and is overly-obsessed with [From.GetHerHis] image.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE_ZE_13064;Doing anything else takes time away from looking my best!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ZE_13081;So much to do, and so little time! Sometimes I get overwhelmed and lose track of what I need to be doing.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCC_ZE_13084;[From.GetTitledFirstName] says that a righteous cause to concentrate on would help me stay focused.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ZE_13084;No, I can handle this. Really!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ZE_13111;I love learning about magic. There are other things I'm supposed to do - chores, playtime, bathing - but I don't have time for any of that!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP20800_TIMID_GROOMED_RESP;Doesn't [From.GetFirstName] understand? This is who I am!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_WILLFUL_UNCOUTH;Rules are stupid. Why should I comb my hair? Why do I have to wash up before eating? Why does my room need to be clean? It's a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20800_WILLFUL_UNCOUTH;Nobody tells me what to do!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_WILLFUL_UNCOUTH_ED;[From.GetFirstName] has started going out of [From.GetHerHis] way to disobey the proper rules about cleanliness and keeping a tidy living space.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAHFP20800_WILLFUL_UNCOUTH_RESP;No thanks.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_PLAYFUL_SLOVENLY;I love playing with the other children! Climbing trees, sparring, catching bugs, eating dirt, playing tag in the sewers...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20800_PLAYFUL_SLOVENLY;I don't think I could ever get tired of this!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_PLAYFUL_SLOVENLY_ED;Young [From.GetFirstName] has a complete disreregard for [From.GetHerHis] cleanliness and even [From.GetHerHis] safety.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_PLAYFUL_SLOVENLY_RESP;[From.GetTitledFirstName] disapproves of my carefree attitude and tried to beat it out of me.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20800_PLAYFUL_SLOVENLY_RESP;I've gotten more bruises from playing tag!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_IDOLIZER_UNCOUTH;Studying matters of faith, great men and women, mysteries of the arcane...I'm so busy studying. I don't have time for hygiene, or playing, or even eating!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20800_IDOLIZER_UNCOUTH;Can't they see that I'm very busy!?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_IDOLIZER_UNCOUTH_ED;Little [From.GetFirstName] is putting so much energy into [From.GetHerHis] studies that [From.GetSheHe] is becoming increasingly gruff, distanced, and weird...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDHFP20800_IDOLIZER_UNCOUTH_RESP;[From.GetTitledFirstName] thinks that I should spend less time studying, and be more courteous and empathetic.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHFP20800_IDOLIZER_UNCOUTH_RESP;No! Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;x
