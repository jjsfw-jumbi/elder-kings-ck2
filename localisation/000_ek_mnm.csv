[Root.job_spiritual.GetFirstName], joined by several guards, begins taunting [accused_lycan.GetFirstName], before throwing hunks of cow carcass into the cage. [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] breaks into a sweat, and shortly thereafter, transforms into a werewolf! Worked into a frenzy, [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] snarls and growls, and futilely attempts to break free.;;;;;;;;;x

[Root.job_spiritual.GetFirstName], joined by several guards, begins taunting [accused_lycan.GetFirstName], before throwing hunks of cow carcass into the cage. [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] glares back from inside the enclosure. After a while, a bemused [Root.job_spiritual.GetFirstName] decides to stop the test, deeming the results "inconclusive.";;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs245C;[Root.job_spiritual.GetFirstName] shoves [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] into a cage. [Root.job_spiritual.GetFirstName], joined by several guards, begins taunting [accused_lycan.GetFirstName], before throwing hunks of cow carcass into the cage. [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] glares back from inside the enclosure. From inside the cage, [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] calmly looks at us and transforms into a werewolf! The crowd is stunned, but [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] exhibits no savage behavior, and claims to have [accused_lycan.GetHerHis] beast-blood under control.;;;;;;;;;x

EKJobs245OptA;Throw the werewolf into the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs245OptB;I command you to let [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] go at once!;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs245OptC;This test is over. Let [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] go, now!;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs245OptD;[accused_lycan.GetFirstName] could still be a werewolf! Throw [accused_lycan.GetHerHim] into the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs250A;My plea falls on deaf ears as [my_liege.GetBestName] has me hauled away to the dungeon and locked in a cold, dark cell. At least the rats in here would be a fine snack...;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs250B;Despite passing [my_liege.job_spiritual.GetFirstName]'s absurd "werewolf test," [my_liege.GetTitle] [my_liege.GetFirstName] has me hauled away to the dungeon anyway! I demand to be freed, but the guards don't care - they throw me into a dark cell and lock the door.;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs250OptA;Let me out of here! Let me out!;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs250OptB;I don't belong in here! Let me out!;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs255A;[my_liege.GetBestName] decided that despite my lycanthropy being proven to the court, there was no need to have me imprisoned. I've been released from captivity and am free to do as I please...though doubt remains that I can control my beast form appropriately.;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs255B;Judging by my lack of a transformation despite [my_liege.job_spiritual.GetFirstName]'s alleged "best" efforts, I've proved that I'm no werewolf. [my_liege.GetBestName] ordered me released from custody, though I'm none too happy with [my_liege.job_spiritual.GetFirstName] getting me involved in all this.;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs255OptA;Sooner or later, the call of the blood will be too much to resist...;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs255OptB;The doubters will be proven wrong.;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs255OptC;At least this is over.;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs260;Given that [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] showed no response to my test, it was only fitting that [my_liege.GetBestName] had [accused_lycan.GetHerHim] released. It's safe to say that [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] most likely isn't a werewolf after all.;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs260OptA;And now I look like a fool!;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs265;Given that [accused_lycan.GetFirstName] showed no response to my test and therefore doesn't seem to be a werewolf, the entire court was baffled when [my_liege.GetBestName] had [accused_lycan.GetHerHim] hauled to the dungeons anyway!;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs265OptA;That was unexpected...;;;;;;;;;x
EKJobs265OptB;HA! That will show [accused_lycan.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;x
