#
societieslifestyle.100.d;Sparring with fellow fighters is an excellent way to hone my fighting skills. Though deaths in our arenas are rare, the duels are never easy, and sometimes quite bloody. Yet it's an exhilarating feeling, especially when I emerge victorious and hear my companions cheering me own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.100.optA;I am a gladiator!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.100.optB;The best techniques are passed on by the survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.100.optC;It's great sport, but there are other things I'd rather do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.101.d;Fighting on horseback is a completely different art than fighting on foot, and I've taken to it exceptionally well. I believe I may have found my calling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.101.optA;I am an equestrian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.101.optB;Horsemanship is a skill, not a calling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.102.d1;Even great warriors are at a disadvantage when their equipment is broken and worn down. Fortunately for me, I have a natural skill at manufacturing and repairing arms and armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.102.d2;Self-sufficiency is key to being a successful assassin. The necessity of repairing and replacing my equipment has helped me grasp the fundamentals of smithing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.102.optA;I am a blacksmith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.102.optB;It's a nice talent, but not my interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.103.d;I just realized that Alchemy is a richly rewarding activity. With just a few simple ingredients and some patience, I can craft potions as powerful as any spells!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.103.optA;I am an Alchemist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.103.optB;Alchemy is fun, but I have other studies to focus on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.104.d;Making money is exciting...it's even more exciting when I have to risk money to turn a profit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.104.optA;I am a gambler!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.104.optB;But gambling is wasteful. I'll save my funds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.105.d;Every so often, colleagues at the guild office need my help with improving designs for freight transports, even the freight itself. They tell me that I'm skilled at engineering, and in fact, I find it very enjoyable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.105.optA;I am an engineer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.105.optB;As fun as it can be, it's too stressful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.106.d1;Great music can inspire so much emotion, and fill one with so much energy. And as luck would have it, I'm a natural at making great music! I wonder if I should spend more time performing songs and melodies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.106.d2;While most associate the Sword-Singers with our mastery of the Sword, our predecessors were artists and artisans before they picked up their blades. Lately, I have found myself more in tune with them as I have become engrossed in the study of several forms of music. I wonder if I should continue with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.106.optA;I am a musician!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.106.optB;I like playing music, but there are other things I'd rather do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.107.d;Actions speak louder than words, and a painting is the culmination of days, months, or even years of action from an artist. With only a canvas, a brush and a few pigments, I can express thousands of emotions, swirling together in harmony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.107.optA;Painting is incredible! I must keep at this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.107.optB;As enjoyable as painting may be, there are other things I must do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.108.d;Why is magic so firmly associated with warfare, subterfuge and worship? Why not for entertainment? Dazzling candlelight and magelight, jump spells...there are so many possibilities to use magic just to make the world a little less dull!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.108.optA;I am a magician!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.108.optB;Fun perhaps, but I'll leave magic to the Guild mages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.109.d1;Being a Thief doesn't just mean taking things. It also means breaking things - locks, doors, bindings, buildings, weapons, and more. I've noticed I have a real knack for doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.109.d2;Eliminating a target doesn't just mean using a weapon or spell. Sometimes loosening a stone, pulling a few nails out of a railing or sundering a support are far more effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.109.optA;I am a saboteur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.109.optB;It's a useful skill, but not my focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.110.d;The art of theft requires discretion. Taking someone's hard-earned gold or most prized possession isn't much use if someone catches me immediately after. That goes for hauling contraband too. Thankfully, my discretion is par excellence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.110.optA;I am a smuggler!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
societieslifestyle.110.optB;Smuggling might be profitable...but it's not really my thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
