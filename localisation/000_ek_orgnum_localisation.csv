orgnum.1.opta;But... I am... a god....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.1.title;Orgnum is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.2.title;The Death of Orgnum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum2.accept;Orgnum is no more. The worship of Orgnum should die with [GetOrgnumHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum2.decline;Orgnum persists yet — [GetOrgnumSheHe] has ascended to Aetherius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum2.others;How does this concern us, exactly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum2;Orgnum, the [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] of the Maormer, is dead. On [GetOrgnumHerHis] death, the hold [GetOrgnumSheHe] had on the inhabitants of Pyandonea has all but crumbled. Many of [GetOrgnumHerHis] former subjects are converting to a new school of thought that theorises that Orgnum was never a god as [GetOrgnumSheHe] claimed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.11.t;The Godslayer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.11.d;The Maormer of Pyandonea are still in shock after the death of their [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor]. Some rejoice, and some are devastated, but all agree on one thing: [Root.GetTitledFirstName] slew [GetOrgnumHerHim]. For better or worse, [Root.GetHerHis] actions led directly to the death of Orgnum.\n\nFrom now on, [Root.GetSheHe] will be known as the Godslayer, and [Root.GetHerHis] actions will be remembered for all eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.11.optA;Orgnum is dead, Orgnum remains dead, and I have killed [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x # I'm kind of proud of this one. -PhD
orgnum.20.t;Orgnum the Necromancer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.20.d;We have mastered the art of Necromancy and the manipulation of the dead, but this directly conflicts with a critical part of our faith: the worship of Meridia.\n\nThe Lady of Infinite Energy is in a perpetual battle against the undead and those who command them, which now includes us.\n\nThe faith of our people stands in danger when their divine leader and a core tenet of their faith clash. We must make a choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.20.optA;Our people will listen to their god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_MERIDIA_PYANDONEAIC_PANTHEON_CT;Meridia will be removed from the list of our gods, our people won't be able to take her as a patron deity, and those who already have will have to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.20.optB;If we abandon Meridia, when will our people abandon us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.21.d;Our Divine [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] declared today that the teachings and orders of Meridia, the Lady of Infinite Energy, were in direct conflict with our faith, and [GetOrgnumSheHe] has decided to remove her from our pantheon!\nWe have no choice but to stop worshipping her and find another patron deity to worship...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.21.optA;The will of Orgnum is sacred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.22.d;Orgnum, the [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] of the Maormer, has officially announced that Meridia is not to be worshipped anymore. Some say it is no mere coincidence that Orgnum made this decision so soon after declaring mastery over the dead, a practice most violently loathed by Meridia and her faithful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.22.optA;Interesting changes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.30.t;Orgnum the Dragonborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.30.d;[GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] of the Maormer. High Fane of the Pyandoneaic faithful. And now Dragonborn.\n\nAs proof of our divine essence, the other gods blessed our mortal form with the aspect of the Dragonborn, Master of Dragons, and rightful ruler of Tamriel.\n\nDozens of dragons already flock to our side, and it is said that some of our people have started seeing them as saints and heralds of our divine will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.30.optA;Do venerate the dragons, but don't forget they answer only to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADD_DRAGONS_PYANDONEAIC_PANTHEON_CT;The faithful will gain the ability to summon dragons at the cost of piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.30.optB;I am their sole master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.31.d;Orgnum, [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] of the Maormer, has been blessed by the gods and given the powers of the Dragonborn. Some say [GetOrgnumSheHe] always has several dragons by [GetOrgnumHerHis] side, following [GetOrgnumHerHim] and those [GetOrgnumSheHe] deems worthy in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.31.optA;What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PYANDONEAIC_RELIGION_WORSHIPS_DRAGONS;The Pyandoneaic faith sees dragons as heralds of Orgnum and can summon some to fight for them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.40.t;Orgnum the Lycanthrope;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.40.d;The people of Tamriel have forgotten the strong bond they once had with nature and the wild. The land blesses us with its fertile soil, the waters house our sacred sea serpents, and the winds guide our sails.\n\nTo return to our roots, we have shown the world the powers of the lycanthrope.\n\nSome of our people are already making shrines to Hircine, while others are waiting for us to officialize the Father of Lycanthropy's entry into our pantheon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.40.optA;The Prince of the Hunt will show us how to reunite with nature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADD_HIRCINE_PYANDONEAIC_PANTHEON_CT;Hircine, Prince of the Hunt and Father of Werewolves, will be available as a patron deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.40.optB;This privilege should remain exclusive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.41.d;Orgnum, [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] of the Maormer, officially announced that Hircine, Daedric Prince of the Hunt and Father of Lycanthropes, has joined the Pyandoneaic pantheon.\n\nSome speculate that this is because [GetOrgnumSheHe] recently revealed [GetOrgnumHerHis] lycanthropy to the world, and this announcement is simply to avoid being hunted down by [GetOrgnumHerHis] followers or the neighbouring realms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.41.optA;Interesting changes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum_reclaim_pyandonea;Reclaim Pyandonea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum_reclaim_pyandonea_desc;Our home island has been under attack by dangerous heretics for too long. We tried extending our divine mercy to these heathens, hoping they would rejoin the light of their [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor], but to no avail. We have to crush them and force them to kneel if we want our people to be safe and bask in our divine glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ORGNUM_RECLAIM_PYANDONEA_CT;Pyandonea will finally know peace and safety under its [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.100.t;[GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] of all Maormer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.100.d;Pyandonea was drowning in flames. Daedric cultists, former Altmer traditionalists, and other dangerous heathens plagued the land and its people. It was said that countless storms hit every coast of the island, sea serpents hunted and destroyed fishing ships, and the shrines erected by our people would be destroyed at nightfall.\n\nWe had no choice but to crush all those that threatened our people, showing our loyal subjects that their [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] would not abandon them.\n\nPyandonea is safe. Our people are safe. The streets are chanting my name, and the land is grateful for their [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.100.optA;Pyandonea is reunited under my divine will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PYANDONEA_PROVINCES_PROSPERITY_BONUS_CT;All the provinces in Pyandonea receive a prosperity bonus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.110.t;Orgnum, God of War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.110.d;Remember a time in eons long since passed when our own kin, the hated Altmeri, cast us from our hearth and home.\nOur people came to this once cursed land divided, but together we pierced the mists that sought to blind and deceive us, tamed the beasts of land and sea that sought to devour us, and broke the backs of those that sought to defy us. Now our land, this Pyandonea, stands united, but it is not enough to simply survive. To flourish, we must look back into our past. We will have our vengeance, we will reclaim our birthright, and we will retake that which we were denied!\n\nSummon our serpents, those titans of the waves! Summon your soldiers, don your armors and gather your arms! Soon we will sail for the Eternal Isle and the Maormeri will rise triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.110.optA;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.111.d;Pyandonea is in ebullition! After the [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] of the Maormer, Orgnum, reclaimed the island, [GetOrgnumHerHis] faithful rebuilt the giant temple in the centre of the kingdom. Now, hundreds of zealots flock to the side of Pyandonea's ruler every day, ready for war against their greatest rivals — the Altmer of Alinor.\n\nOrgnum wishes to extend [GetOrgnumHerHis] dominion to the Summerset Isles, and [GetOrgnumHerHis] followers are more than eager to conquer it for [GetOrgnumHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.111.optA;It seems that peace isn't an option...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.115.d;For a moment, peace surrounds you. Alinor, the greatest city of the Summerset Isles, is firmly under your control, and its population deeply loyal to their new god. The task is not yet done, as some parts of the island still don't accept your rightful authority.\n\nBut you can rest for now, knowing you have done more in the last couple of years than your people ever thought possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.115.optA;We aren't done yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ORGNUM_CAN_GIVE_TEMPLE_ORGNUM_SACRISTAN_CT;You are now able to delegate your §YTemple§! to a §YSacristan§!, should you wish to move your capital. To assert total control over the Summerset Isles, you will have to §Ycompletely control the region§! and build a §YRuler Statue§! in the county of Alinor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.120.d;It is finally done. Millennia after being expelled from Alinor, we finally were able to come back, and with great force. The Altmer have been forced to proclaim us their rightful overlords, and our hegemony over both Pyandonea and Alinor is total.\n\nOur people can finally rest, their thirst for vengeance satisfied.\n\nNone can stand up to us now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.120.optA;The Maormer stand triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.121.d;As [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName], after achieving total victory over the Altmer, your people have started to call you God-[Root.GetEmpressEmperorCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.121.optA;As it always should have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.200.t;The Temple of Orgnum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.200.d;Ages ago, our people built a grand temple in our name. It was the centre of our power, and our divine authority was greatly diminished without it. Our recent reconquests of our island finally allowed us to reclaim our Temple.\n\nWe should repair it immediately lest our people slowly lose faith in our divinity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.200.optA;I will not fail my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.201.d;Reparations on our Temple have recently begun. It will take several years due to the centuries of heathen occupation and looting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.201.optA;We have nothing if not time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.202.d;After years of hard work from our people, our Temple is finally repaired. There still are halls to repair and wings to refurnish, but already we are able to lead our people from here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.202.optA;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.203.d;Thanks to years of hard work and the unwavering faith of our people, our Temple is now bigger than it has ever been before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum.203.optA;I will not fail my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### Decisions
orgnum_expand_summerset;Launch an Expedition Against Summerset;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orgnum_expand_summerset_desc;The Altmer of the Summerset Isles banished us to our island ages ago. Ever since, we have tried to reclaim it to no avail. But now that our reign over Pyandonea is total, it might be time to finally reclaim our former homeland...\nOnce we have the Summerset Isles under our control, it might be possible to extend our power to the rest of Tamriel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

orgnum_reclaim_summerset_part_1_desc;Our armies, guided by our divine will, were successful in taking control of Alinor, the most important city of the Summerset Isles.

summon_sea_serpents_orgnum_staff;Summon the Sea Serpents;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
summon_sea_serpents_orgnum_staff_desc;And with a single strike of the staff, the Sea seemed to boil and a horde of Serpents emerged. The Faithful trembled, for the mighty beasts seemed willing to attack them. But the [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] struck again, and the Sea Serpents bowed to their overlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heal_wounds_orgnum_armor;Heal Your Wounds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heal_wounds_orgnum_armor_desc;No matter how many times the steel clashed with the scales, the First Serpent always seemed to heal its wounds faster than they could be dealt. But when the [GetOrgnumGodKingEmperor] used [GetOrgnumHerHis] Staff, the Serpent fell, and his skin was used to forge the Opulchian Armour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HAS_NOT_USED_ORGNUM_ARMOR_CT;Can only use the Opulchian Armour once every 5 years;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
