almsivi_DESC;The Tribunal Temple is the native religion of the Dunmer, the inhabitants of Morrowind. They worship the living Gods, Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec, known together as the Almsivi, and revere the “good Daedra” as well as an extensive chain of saints. The Almsivi origin lies in the end of the War of The First Council when the Chimer (who later would be turned into the Dunmer) won the war against the Dwemer and took the Tools of Kagrenac the Master Craftsman for themselves. Years later, Sotha Sil found a way to use the Tools on the Heart of Lorkhan and used the Heart’s divine power to create the Tribunal. With their new-found divine power the Almsivi did great deeds for the Dunmer and were, in turn, worshipped by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kapotun_pantheon_DESC;The Kapotun Patheon is a complex almagation of gods and beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alikr_DESC;A natural evolution of the Yokudan's Sakatal-centered faith, the Alik’r religion has, as chieftain of the pantheon, Ruptga, or Tall Papa, the first to survive Satakal's destruction. Others Gods include Zeht, Tall Papa's wife Morwha, Tava, HoonDing, Leki, Onsi, Diagna and Tu'whacca, who was thought to be some sort of god of apathy before the creation of the world, when he became a caretaker and protector of souls. The Yokudan creation myth involved Sep, a "crazy" merchant god who convinced the others to create the mortal world to make it easier for more spirits to survive Satakal's inevitable onslaught. Except it didn't make it easier. Rather, the mortal plane acts as a trap and makes apotheosis even harder. In this way, the Redguard view of creation has more in common with the Elven tradition than that of other humans, who view the mortal plane as a blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apologist_DESC;The Apologists believe that Mundus and the mortal plane are not as bad as the purist Mer make it sound and do not wish to see its end or to be freed from it. They mostly worship [Root.GetStendarr], who, in early Aldmeri legends, is considered the “Apologist of Man” and hold a grudge against the other Aldmeri Gods and their adherents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
arcturian_DESC;Followers of the scandalous book known as the Arcturian Heresy, the Arcturians believe that Talos, hero-god of Mankind, is nothing more than a fraud. By their doctrines, Talos of Atmora is, in fact, Hjalti Early-Beard, a Breton of High Rock Amidst rumors of a warlord destined to rule Tamriel, he rose to prominence in the service of King Cuhlecain and fought to unify Cyrodiil. Few knew of the existence of his secret ally, the Underking, Ysmir Kingmaker. The Underking provided assistance to the young General, but the manner of his assistance is vaguely described in the book. There are references to a storm that talks all night with Hjalti and deflected arrows while Hjalti shouted down the wall of Old Hrol'dan, where Hjalti was given the name Talos, meaning Stormcrown, by his men. This storm is most likely the Underking, as his body had recently been blasted to ash by the Greybeards, and he is referred to as 'Ysmir, the Grey Wind' and 'the Storm of Kyne'. After the province was conquered, Hjalti murdered Cuhlecain and his contingent in the Imperial City and blamed the deaths and ensuing blaze on assassins from High Rock. The Underking continued to aid in his conquests, and Hjalti took the name Tiber Septim, ascending to the Ruby Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
auriel_DESC;The original Aldmeri pantheon consists of Auri-El, Jephre, Lorkhan, Magnus, Trinimac, Phynaster, Xen, Xarxes, [Root.GetStendarr], Syrabane and Mara. The pantheon’s chief god, Auri-El, is linked Anui-El and to Anu, the Everything, and is also the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons, with most Altmer and Bosmer claiming direct descent from him. In a moment of weakness, Auri-El agreed to take his part in the creation of Mundus, which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, he helped to defeat the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times and establish the first kingdoms of the Aldmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey, before ascending to heaven to teach his followers how they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brethren_DESC;A dangerous cult from the Colovian West, their followers are secretive and keen to make sacrifices to their mysterious lords, the Deep Ones, who are said to live in caverns all over the underground of Colovia and grant fortune and prosperity to their followers. The process of contacting the Deep Ones involve hours of worship, countles readings of the Bible of the Deep Ones and, more strangely, living years underground in the hope of seeing a Deep One with your own eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While the faith remains far less centralised than worship of the Divines, the introduction of a dedicated priest caste has done much to bring even the most isolated and barbaric communities of the Reach into the fold of religious orthodoxy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

aedra_DESC;The original pantheon of the post-Alessian eras, consisting of Akatosh, [Root.GetArkay], Dibella, [Root.GetJulianos], [Root.GetKynareth], Mara, [Root.GetStendarr], and Zenithar. Worship of the Eight Divines was introduced by Alessia at the start of the First Era. This was a carefully designed compromise between the Aldmeri deities that the humans of Cyrodiil were accustomed to worshipping under Ayleid rule and the deities of Alessia's Nordic allies. This compromise didn’t occur without losses, as both the proto-Imperials and the Nords disliked the new perversions of their respective deities, which became a serious point of contention and religious unrest. The Eight Divines eventually reached prominence through the conquests of the Alessian Order and the later Cyrodiilic Empire, going on to became one of the most widespread and dominant religions in Tamriel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nine_divines_DESC;The Nine Divines are the original Eight Divines, augmented with the newly-ascended human known as Talos. Worship of the Nine Divines was established as the Imperial religion in the wake of Tiber Septim's death and apparent ascension under his Nordic name, Talos. Under the leadership of the Imperial Cult, the faith spread quickly from a nascent warrior cult to an Empire-spanning religion, with adopters spread through all the conquered provinces of Tamriel, eventually almost entirely usurping the traditional Eight Divines. The worship of a "man" side-by-side with older Aldmeri-inspired Gods led, of course, to intense debate and conflict with more traditional Altmer and Auri-El devotees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Anu or his equivalent under a different name is present in every culture's traditions. For instance, the Khajiit refer to him as "Ahnurr", and he is a "litter-mate" to "Fadomai". Anuic faiths are dualistic, seeing the world and life as a conflict between Anuic (Order) and Padomaic (Chaos) forces and spirits with Anuic faithful generally viewing themselves as the footsoldiers of order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

eight_ysmir_DESC;Much like the Emperor Cults of Cyrodiil, the Ysmir Cult of the Nords worships the Kings of Skyrim. Among these kings, the most revered is Ysmir Wulfharth, the Atmoran-born High King of Skyrim. He submitted Skyrim to a fiery reinstatement of the traditional Nordic pantheon, destroying Alessian temples and forcing the remnants of its priesthood to seek refuge in the Heartland. Many Ysmir Cultists believe Wulfharth was not a mere man, but one of a series of avatars sent by Shor - the Shezarrines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

divines_akatosh_DESC;The Hourists are close followers of Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time. While Akatosh is seen as the chief deity in almost every Tamrielic pantheon, the Hourists see him as the inviolate ruler of all other Aedra. Hourism is particularly popular in Cyrodiil, as Akatosh forged a blood-bond with the nascent empire of humanity and bestowed the Amulet of Kings upon Saint Alessia and her kin. Hourist Cults are also present in Daggerfall, chiefly in the form of the Akatosh Chantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is presumed that [Root.GetArkay] did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

divines_dibella_DESC;Lillians are close followers of Dibella, Goddess of Beauty. Lillian cults encompass a wide variety of individuals with many devoted to women, artists, and 'practitioners of erotic instruction.' Unlike many other faiths, the worship of Dibella is considered highly personal and intimate. Rather than having a vast hierarchy, the Lillians' chief religious mediums are the Sybils of Dibella, who act as a link between worshippers and the Goddess herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

divines_julianos_DESC;Scholastics are close followers of [Root.GetJulianos], God of Knowledge. [Root.GetJulianos] is the Cyrodilic god of literature, law, history, and contradiction. In addition, he is usually associated with magick and thus is often revered by wizards. The Scholastics place great emphasis on learning, and for this reason many of their temples also function as universities or colleges. [Root.GetJulianos]' followers are told to "Know the truth. Observe the law. When in doubt, seek wisdom from the wise.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's divine plan to create the mortal plane, and provides the space in the void for its creation. Furthermore, she is associated with rain, a phenomenon that is said not to have occurred before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Benevolence's priests and priestesses study the greatness of Mara's Tamriel and are said to have learned much, so there is much secret knowledge that is shared with initiates who are judged to be true to Mara's duty. The true calling of the Benevolences is to unite all children of Mara through her endless love for all beings. They are intolerant only of those who show intolerance and hate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While [Root.GetStendarr] is also considered the God of Mercy, the Vigilants believe there are many for whom mercy is a quick death. The Vigilants are a cult of holy warriors who swear solemn vows to uproot and destroy Daedra, 'abominations,' and any who worship these foul beings. While the Vigilants may bless those who cross them with [Root.GetStendarr]'s mercy, it is only because they themselves offer none in their holy battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

divines_zenithar_DESC;Resolutionists are close followers of Zenithar, God of Work. Zenithar is considered a more cultivated god of merchants and middle nobility. His priests teach that the path to peace and prosperity is through earnest work and honest profit, not through war, bloodshed, or theft. Zenithar is seen as a warrior god, but one who is restrained and reserved in times of peace. His worshippers say that, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god 'that will always win'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nine_lorkhan;Lorkhan Cult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nine_lorkhan_DESC;Cults to Lorkhan, the Spirit of Nirn and God of all Mortals, have existed in Tamriel for as long as history records. Though Lorkhan is long dead, he is worshipped in nearly every pantheon as the 'Missing God.' The Lorkhanites, however, worship him as a guardian and protector of man. Talos, one of the hero-gods of mankind, was a shezarrine - one of Lorkhan's divine agents. The Merish hatred of Lorkhan for 'trapping' them on Nirn is also a source of pride for many Lorkhanites who still bear a grudge against the ancient elves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nine_shezarrine;Shezarrine Cult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nine_shezarrine_DESC;The Shezarrines are a series of heroes and immortal champions throughout history who are believed to be avatars or incarnations of the missing god Lorkhan sent to guide or defend Humanity. Generally Shezarrine Cults are messianic, preparing for the coming of the Shezarrine to save mankind while others are personality cults around a, usually self-declared, 'Shezarrine'. Before the advent of Talos Shezarrine Cults were generally accepted or at least tolerated by authorities but since the Ascension are seen as denying or defying the Divinity of Talos, who the Nine Divine's orthodoxy see as the true Shezarrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nine_talos;Talos Cult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nine_talos_DESC;Unlike its Talosian ancestor, the Talos Cult is equal parts religious and political organization. The Talos Cultists worship Talos primarily in his aspect as the warrior-god of man and conqueror of Tamriel. In order to join, new recruits must swear the following oath: 'That we shall die to put a strong man back on the throne of Tamriel.' Talos Cultists will not hesitate to assassinate the current ruler if they believe they are too weak to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

alikr_ebonarm_DESC;Ebonarm or the Black Knight is the God of War and the companion and protector of all warriors. He is said to ride a golden stallion named War Master. His ebony sword is fused to his right arm - a result of the wounds he suffered in the titanic battles of the past. His symbol is a red rose and his alter a sanctified Holy Anvil. Throughout most of the Alik'r Desert Fighters Guild guildhalls are actually mosques dedicated to Him known as Citadels of Ebonarm. He is an enemy of most of the Daedric Princes (all except Sheogorath) as well as the Temple of [Root.GetStendarr] and has no alliances. While Ebonarm is included in the Yokudan Pantheon where the faith has its roots, the followers of Ebonarm worship him alone as the sole god of war, battles and warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
psijic_mysticism;Psijic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
psijic_mysticism_DESC;The Old Ways or Mysticism, most well known outside of the Summerset Isles as the beliefs and philosophy of the mysterious Psijic Order of Artaeum is the pure, ecumenical ancestor worship once supposedly practised by the orginal Aldmer, founded by Aldmer Elders in the earliest days of elven history who rejected the worshipping only the ancestors claimed by the elite of the Aldmeri society, from which the traditional Aldmeri pantheon of Aedra emerged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

aedric_magnus;Magnus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aedric_magnus_DESC;Magnus was the god who designed Mundus, the mortal realm, during its creation. After it was completed, however, he ordered the project terminated, and left for Aetherius at great cost. In doing so, he tore a hole in the veil of Oblivion through which the magicka of Aetherius flows into the world. The great rift he left behind, the sun, is itself known as Magnus. He is worshipped as the god of Sight, Light, Insight, the sun and the source of magick by the elves while human legends say Magnus can inhabit the bodies of powerful mages and lend them his power. He is also associated with Zurin Arctus, the Underking and is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff. Worshippers of Magnus often consider him the greatest or the true ruler of the Gods above all others and are often accused of primitive sun or magick worship by their enemies. Magnus is most commonly worshipped by Mer and Breton mages. The Adamantine Tower is the foremost location associated with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Anui-El is the personification of the Aurbis, or totality of creation, preservation and stability. The Aldmer especially revere the Aurbis as Anui-El, the Soul of the Void. Anui-El is seen as an equal but opposing force to Sithis.

pact_fundamentalist_DESC;The Storyteller Cult is so extremist in their believes and practices that they have been declared infidels by the Silvenar. Their name derivates from Y'ffre, who is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
baan_dar;Baan Dar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
baan_dar_DESC;Baan Dar, the Bandit God, is an obscure deity worshipped by relatively few in Tamriel. Those that do recognize him are mainly found in Valenwood and Elsweyr. The main source of information is the Scroll of Baan Dar, which was discovered in the early Second Era near a lake in Elsweyr and described by Arkan, Scribe of Daggerfall, in early 2E 24. In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal deity, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiiti, whose last minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies. Some scholars believe that Baan Dar merely refers to a manner of living, rather than a true god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
anuic_skaal;All-Maker;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
anuic_skaal_DESC;The All-Maker, God of the Skaal, is a mysterious deity revered as the wellspring of creation at the centre of the dualistic religion of Solstheim. Nature and the cycle of life and death are revered as the sacred gifts of the All-Maker. The Rituals and traditions of the Skaal honour the six great gifts of the All-Maker - flora, fauna, the sun, the earth, water, and wind. Though first worshipped by the distant ancestors of the Nords, reverence for the All-Maker is now nearly extinct. However, the isolated Skaal of Solstheim preserved the ancient beliefs throughout the ages. The All-Maker and the Adversary are comparable to Anu and Padomay leading outside scholars to categorise the faith as a local variation on the monomyth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

almsivi_anticipations_DESC;The Good Daedra are known to the ALMSIVI Temple as the Anticipations, since they are the early ancestral anticipations of the loving patronage of the Tribunal. The Anticipations are the Daedra Lords Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura. The Anticipationists view the Tribunal as aspects or avatars of the Good Daedra rather than as divine in themselves. The Temple classifies them as a civilised Daedra Cult as they worship the Daedra but through the traditions and practices of the Tribunal Temple. The Anticipationists seek to reform or 'reclaim' the Temple, establishing the Good Daedra as the true focus of devotion of Worship and the Tribunal as the means through which to worship them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
almsivi_dissident_priests;Dissident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
almsivi_dissident_priests_DESC;The Dissident Priests are a secretive cult consisting of Tribunal Temple members who dispute the Temple's dogmatic foundations and question the process of the Tribunal's elevation to become gods. They argue Temple doctrine and are uneasy about the practices of the Ordinators. One of the chief disputes between the Temple and the Dissident Priests is that the Temple hides the truth from its followers. The Dissident Priests' outline and their beliefs are manifested in the book Progress of Truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
almsivi_old_velothi;High Velothi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
almsivi_old_velothi_DESC;The High Velothi faith covers all those who follow the teachings, traditions and beliefs of the Prophet Veloth, be they ultra-traditionalists strongholds, dissident re-creationists or Ashlander tribes. In the Late Middle Merethic Era, Veloth was a prophet and mystic who believed the Aldmer culture in Summerset Isle had become decadent. He therefore led the Chimer (the ancestors of modern-day Dunmer) into the promised land of Morrowind. Veloth also taught the difference between the Good and Bad Daedra,and won the aid of the Good Daedra for his people while teaching how to carefully negotiate with the Bad Daedra. Veloth's teachings of fundamentalist Ancestor Worship are still practised by the Ashlanders who see themselves as direct descendants of the Aldmeri peoples who followed the Prophet Veloth. Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual 'Chimer', or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magick to 'responsible' architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. The spiritual beliefs and metaphysical ideals of Lord Vivec spring directly from the teachings of Veloth, whose movement he regarded as an element of barbarism necessary to break from Altmeri culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He is said to have created the island of Solstheim in a battle against another dragon priest and to have been able to command the will of men and dragons alike.

Xarxes then gave this knowledge to Dagon, who scribed the Mysterium Xarxes in "the deserts of rust and wounds". The tome was an artifact of great - and evil - power. The book was dangerous to handle. Reading from it required magickal protection from its power. Xarxes Cults include the Mythic Dawn who played a key role in the Oblivion Crisis at the end of the Third Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In times before recorded history, Jyggalag had grown in power, and the other Daedric Princes had grown fearful and jealous of him. They cursed him to live as Sheogorath, the incarnation of the thing he hated most: madness. He was, however, allowed to return to his true form at the end of every era in order to retake the Shivering Isles from his mad alter-ego in an event known as the Greymarch. However, once this was done, Jyggalag transformed back into Sheogorath, starting the cycle again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

animism_DESC;Animism is generally a belief system rooted in spirits of animals and the natural world.  The Skaal in Solstheim are probably the most well-known animists in Mundus, believing that when something dies, be it an animal or a person, the spirit of the deceased is returned to the All-Maker, who then reforms it into a new being and returns it to the mortal plane, to live out a new life, in a new body. Thus, all life is sacred to the Skaal, and they try to live in harmony with nature, impacting their environment as little as possible. They hunt deer, bear, and horker, only to the extent necessary for survival, never for enjoyment or practice, and gather their firewood from dead trees that have already fallen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Many of Bhut's devotees believe that because of his status as a fertility god, he is the progenitor of his brethren and the Tang Mo themselves. Due to his status as the god of the sea, his worshippers content that he guides and connects the people of the Thousand Monkey Isles more than any other.

cult_greybeards_DESC;The Greybeards, an ancient and honoured order of monks who live in silence at the ancient monastery, High Hrothgar, near the summit of the Throat of the World. They are the most famous of the Tongues, or masters of the Voice. They follow the teachings of Jurgen Windcaller, who believed the power of the Voice was a means of attaining enlightenment. Jurgen called his new philosophy the Way of the Voice, and preached a lifestyle of meditative study of the Voice which the Greybeards carry on to this day. Contrary to popular misconceptions, the Greybeards are not, strictly speaking, pacifists. The Way of the Voice teaches only that violence is the least of the Voice's uses, and it should be used for that purpose only in times of "True Need". The coming of a Dragonborn is considered such a time, thus the violent use of the Voice by a Dragonborn is "overlooked", though the other followers of the Way are expected to remain peaceful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unlike most of the Daedric Princes, Azura is generally considered to be benevolent. Proud and graceful, she rules from the vibrant plane of Moonshadow and jealously guards her worshippers. Azura’s Star, an unbreakable soul gem, is her foremost artifact. Azura appreciates steadfast piety but viciously penalizes perceived slights, the most infamous instance being when she transformed the Chimer of Resdayn into the ashen-skinned, red-eyed Dunmer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

daedra_boethiah_DESC;Boethiah carries many titles, such as the Prince of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Goddess of Destruction and, among Almsivi worshippers, as the Anticipation of Almalexia. Notorious for a penchant for the suffering of mortals, Boethiah rules over deceit, conspiracy, intrigues of murder and assassination, and the unlawful overthrow of authority. Unlike most Princes, Boethiah does not have a settled gender and can appear as male or female. Boethiah has two especially noteworthy artifacts: Goldbrand, a dragon-forged golden katana enchanted with fire, and the Ebony Mail, a suit of armour which enshrouds the wearer and poisons nearby foes. These have traditionally been granted to those who exhibit exceptional martial prowess and personal initiative. Boethiah’s faithful are frequently called upon to duel one another in tournaments to the death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Almost constantly accompanied by his shapeshifting companion Barbas, this capricious Prince relishes tricking supplicants with agreements that end with logical but unforeseen and often deadly consequences. Among his artifacts are Umbra, a soul-capturing sword, and the Masque of Clavicus Vile, a helm which makes the wearer unusually charismatic. Winning his courtesy is dangerous and difficult, but lucrative for those he favours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

daedra_hermaeus_DESC;The Prince of fate, knowledge and memory, Hermaeus Mora commands a nearly endless assortment of information from his realm of Apocrypha. Hermaeus Mora’s preeminent artifact is the Oghma Infinium, a tome which grants the reader powerful insights before fading back into Oblivion. He is neither benevolent nor malevolent and his attitude is one of pragmatism. He has constant drive to acquire yet more knowledge to keep as his own. Keeping in line with this, devotees to Hermaeus Mora carry out tasks as innocuous as reading books or puzzle-solving and as fiendish as murder and the propagation of plagues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Hircine created the various therianthropic diseases affecting Nirn, earning him the nickname, Father of Manbeasts. He relishes the pursuit of prey, but is equally pleased when a quarry can spin the Great Game around and turn hunter into hunted. Hircine’s major artifacts are his Ring, which transforms the wearer into a werewolf, and a magic-resistant leather cuirass known as the Savior's Hide. Great hunters most easily earn Hircine’s favour, as do werewolves and other man-beasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Natural hazards such as volcanoes and earthquakes are associated with him. Mehrunes' destructive potential is so great that his Razor, a compact dagger, carries the potential to fell any foe in a single hit. Worshippers of Dagon are commonly directed to wreak havoc upon Nirn, causing wanton destruction and even overthrowing ruling dynasties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unlike most Princes, Mephala often appears as male or female, but prefers to be addressed as female. Mephala is often associated with lies, sex and murder, and thoroughly approves of intrigues that involve these activities. Mephala possesses two especially powerful artifacts: the first is the dreaded Ebony Blade, a Dai-Katana that winnows the very life essence from targets and grants their vitality to the wielder. The other is the Ring of Khajiiti (also associated with Meridia), which bolster’s the wearer’s stealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

daedra_meridia_DESC;Meridia, the Lady of Infinite Energies, is a Prince whose sphere is poorly understood except for an association with the life forces of living things. She despises all manner of undead and often beckons her champions to destroy them in her name. Meridia is known for gifting her worthy with the stealth-bolstering Ring of Khajiiti (also associated with Mephala) and the dazzling Dawnbreaker, a sword which sears foes with purifying fire. Those who dabble in necromancy risk inciting her vindictive wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

daedra_molag_DESC;Prince of domination and the enslavement of mortals, Molag Bal is widely considered to be one of the most evil and malicious Daedric lords. His sobriquet, the King of Rape, is a testament to his spiteful demeanor. Vampires are known to hail him as a patron, and it is believed that vampires were first brought into Nirn through his repugnant deeds. The Mace of Molag Bal, an accursed soul-stealing weapon, is his most prized artifact. Worshippers of Molag Bal are frequently commanded to break the wills of his enemies and bind them to eternal servitude in Coldharbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

daedra_namira_mod;Namira Worshipper;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
daedra_namira_DESC;Namira, the Lady of Decay, is the Prince of ancient darkness and revels in revulsion. Mortals frequently associate her with spiders, insects, slugs and other creatures which they find offensive. The Ring of Namira is her artifact of choice. It is an item rumored to have powers as mighty as reflecting damage back at an attacker, or as repugnant as empowering a wearer when they engage in cannibalism. Namira worshippers who subject themselves to squalor are those most likely to gain this mysterious Prince’s recognition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

daedra_nocturnal_DESC;Daedric Prince of night and darkness, the furtive and subtle Nocturnal is poorly understood. Also known as the Mistress of Shadows, she rules from the plane of Oblivion known as Evergloam. Nocturnal is most commonly worshipped by thieves, and for good reason: her most powerful artifacts, the identity-concealing Cowl of Nocturnal, and the lock-breaching Skeleton Key, are especially suited to stealth and subterfuge. Such acts please her greatly, and she remunerates her most competent devotees by further honing their talents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite being considered one of the weakest Daedric Princes, he is well-known for afflicting mortals with virulent plagues that can bring whole nations to their knees. His most famous artifact is Spellbreaker, an ancient Dwemer shield with a magical ward. Peryite's followers are frequently “blessed” with fiendish ailments which they transmit to unsuspecting victims, but which tend to do little to no damage to the Peryite worshippers themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

daedra_sanguine_DESC;Sanguine is the Prince of debauchery and dark indulgences. He is believed to lord over thousands of realms in Oblivion. Nonetheless, of all the Daedric Princes, he is known to be one of the most active in Nirn. Brothels and similar establishments often bear his seal. The Sanguine Rose is counted among his artifacts. It is a powerful staff with the ability to summon a limited number of Dremora before fading back into Oblivion.

He has no moral alignment, as alignment implies stability and stability is anathema to his ways. Worshippers of Sheogorath are often brought to the precipice of utter insanity, and many do not maintain their mental health for long. Those who perform bizarre tasks on his behalf often receive spectacular rewards, including the reality-altering Wabbajack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Her realm, Quagmire, is a plane of perpetual horror where reality constantly shifts into increasingly terrifying scenes. Vaermina's grandest artifact is the Skull of Corruption, a nefarious staff which grows in power by feeding on the dreams of hapless, sleeping mortals. Vaermina’s devotees constantly search for new ways to tap into the power of sleep, and are noted to be granted incredible insights into manipulating dreams in order to alter waking reality...often at the cost of the well-being of others, and sometimes at their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The worship of the Old Gods has few defined rituals or practices and most Reach clans have their own unique priest class, traditions, and beliefs.

dragon_cult_DESC;The Dragon Cult began as a sect within the traditions of animal worship brought by Atmorans to Tamriel. Certain scholars believe these were "totem animals" for the modern Divines, in which case, worship of the dragon corresponded to worship of Akatosh. Dragons were revered more than any other, and they were comfortable in assuming positions as god-kings over men. Their servants, the dragon priests, kept the peace between dragons and men, and their power was so great that uttering any word for "dragon" was forbidden to all mankind except them. They made laws for the society of men, and were on par with kings. Grand temples were built to honour the dragons and appease them in life and death, many of which survive as draugr-infested ruins today. The dragon priests were promised eternal life for their service, which they receive by absorbing the life force of their servants over the millennia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

five_courts_DESC;The Five Courts of the Tsaesci is a pantheon of Celestial Serpents, each representing the celestial bodies and movements and the four seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, with a fifth "Elder" Serpent as the Tsaesci cognate of Anu. The Five Courts faith teaches that the Tsaesci were born from the blood of the Elder Serpent that spilled upon Nirn as he battled with his brother, the World-Eater, the Void Serpent. Five Courts worshippers believe that all blood contains some of the Elder Serpent's divinity and spiritual energy, and frequently ingest it to bring themselves closer to him and increase their own power. This faith also teaches that dragons are sacred children of the Elder Serpent, but whose forms in the mortal plane were corrupted by the World-Eater Serpent. The Tsaesci see it as their divine duty to free the Dragon's souls from their corrupted bodies, returning them to the aether to await the time when the last avatar of the Elder Serpent is birthed upon the world. This "divine recepticle" will then "drink" the splintered souls of the dragons, reuniting them into the single whole and elevating the Tsaesci, the chosen people, to god-like status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

forsworn_heresy_DESC;The birth of the Hagraven Cults can be traced back to the Cyrodiilic invasion of the Reach in the First Era. King Faolan of the Reach, known popularly as 'Red Eagle,' resisted Empress Hestra's Imperial Legions bitterly. With defeat looming, Faolan traded his heart, will, and humanity to the Hagravens in return for terrible power as a Briarheart. While Red Eagle was eventually slain, the Hagraven Cults did not perish with him. Considered barbaric even by their own Reachmen kin, the Hagraven Cults revere the monstrous witches and their puppets. Many of the Cults eagerly prophesize the return of Red Eagle, who will once again cleanse in the Reach in a tide of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

green_pact_DESC;The Green Pact is a loosely-assembled code upheld by the Bosmer of Valenwood, it prohibits the use of any wood or vegetable matter of Valenwood as building materials, and requires that Bosmer be strict carnivores. This non-vegetarian practice is part of the Meat Mandate, a section of the pact that also states a Bosmer must eat his fallen enemy. This cannibalistic nature sets them apart religiously from other nations. The Bosmer allegedly made the Green Pact with Y'ffre the Forest Deity in return for Y'ffre's patronage and perhaps protection. As a result, the Bosmer use bone, animal, and insect products widely. Imported wood is used when necessary. There are also almost no cities or towns built by the Bosmer themselves. Additionally, the Green Pact made the felling of trees by anyone, foreign or native, a crime against the Bosmeri religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Religiously, it aims to codify the Green Pact teachings in an effort to formalize its application and avoid the constant misunderstandings between different tribes. The movement has been historically considered a threat by the ancient Camoran Dynasty of Valenwood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Many rumours and myths circulate these ancient beings, though it is generally agreed they are amongst the oldest, if not -the- oldest beings to inhabit Nirn. The Argonian native faith revolves around the Hist and their hallucinogenic Sap, allowing them to 'commune' with the Hist. The Sap can also be used to create armour, as it hardens it becomes like stone. Other races who attempt to ingest the Hist sap often experience negative effects, and depending on the amount ingested, it can lead to insanity or worse.  Fortunately the Argonians are immune to many of these negative effects, although in large amounts or from tainted sources they too can succumb to the ills of their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

maruhkati_DESC;The Alessian faith follows the teachings of Maruhk the Seer, a First Era prophet who rose to prominence during the Camoran Dynasty and became especially esteemed among the inhabitants of Cyrodiil. Maruhk's teachings sparked the massive cultural and spiritual movement known as the Alessian Order, a theocracy that transformed the Empire and the continent. Marukh is credited with writing the Alessian Doctrines, which provided the basis of law within the Cyrodiilic Empire. Marukh's teachings questioned the validity of Elven rule after speaking to the "Enlightened One", Saint Alessia, in a vision. These sentiments led to an increasingly abstract and unknowable depiction of a Single God. Those teachings heavily influenced the Alessian Order and their secret sect, the Maruhkati Selective, and the priesthood of Marukh saw no difference between spiritual and political matters. For a time it usurped the Eight Divines as the religion of the Cyrodiilic Emperors, and it taught that to resist the Emperor was to resist the will of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nerevarine_DESC;The Nerevarine Cult, associated mostly with the Urshilaku Ashlanders, believes that the Tribunal, the three god-kings Vivec, Almalexia and Sotha Sil, are false gods whose power is stolen from Heart of Lorkhan. Instead of worshipping the Tribunal, the cult is devoted to a mortal leader who died of his wounds after victory in the Battle of Red Mountain: Lord Indoril Nerevar. Vivec was his lieutenant, Almalexia was his queen, and Sotha Sil was his wizardly adviser. The cult also believes that, in the end, Nerevar will return in a new incarnation (the Nerevarine or Incarnate) to reunite the Dunmer and bring down the gods they see to be false. The cult's most prevalent belief is that the Tribunal morally betrayed Nerevar by going against his dying wishes and advice to not take the power of the Heart, an artifact of ultimate evil. Because of this evil, all the good that they do with their stolen power will eventually be undone or corrupted and they are doomed to weaken and fail over time. Dagoth Ur, however, will become stronger as he uses the same stolen powers for evil, the true purpose of the Heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

night_court_DESC;The Night Court is a heresy of the Tsaesci Five Courts which has taken a view that the Five Serpents are actually deceased, with their celestial bodies forming the plane of existence the Tsaesci inhabit. Worship and iconography is very similar to the original Five Courts, however the adherents of the Night Court do not directly worship the Serpents themselves, rather they worship all of creation and its creatures. One particularly alien concept it seems amongst the Night Court is that of pacifism. The Night Court worshippers take a vow upon their induction into the faith to never lift their hands in anger against another living, sentient creature. For this reason, they are all avowed vegetarians, and view the Tsaesci cultural tradition of blood-drinking to be an abomination. In addition, Night Court worshippers cannot wage offensive wars as it goes against the core of their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

These Four Kings all brought havoc on the Chimer settlements, each in their own way. The King of Madness would tear them apart, pitting themselves one against another. The King of Destruction would rampage through their lands, leaving nothing behind by burning their fields and flooding their coast. The King of Torment would plague the Chimer population by forcing them to birth abominations and monstrosities. Finally, the King of Curses would haunt their towns and settlements, slaughtering all those who could not fight back. Following the peace treaties between the Chimer and the Islanders, the worship of the Four Kings dwindled over time. But there are still whispers of recluse temples where Chimer are sacrificed to appease these strange but powerful gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

riddlethar_DESC;A monomythic society, the Khajiit are led in their beliefs by mysterious figures known as "Clan Mothers", whose duty it is to disseminate the cultural myths among their kind, and who maintain autonomy from the Mane and the disparate tribal leaders. On the origin of their species, the Khajiit believe that life originated with two litter-mates, Ahnurr and Fadomai, who gave birth to the first cat, Alkosh. To Alkosh was given the guardianship of time, and whose birth prompted Ahnurr and Fadomai to bring forth further life into the world, thus they created Khenarthi, Magrus, Mara and S'rendarr.  In time, Ahnurr and Fadomai wished to share the happiness they felt in life with further children, and so, Fadomai gave birth to Hermorah, Hircine, Merrunz, Mafala, Sangiin, Sheggorath and many others. Despite the phonetic and circumstantial similarities with deities in many other pantheons, the Khajiit maintain that many of these are wholly separate entities from similar spirits in other cultures and their version of the world's genesis as the only pure rendition. The Riddle’thar tenements were established by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta the Mane, who revealed to the Khajiit the existence of the god of cosmic order, Riddle’thar the Sugar God.;;;;;;;;;;x

In constrast to the Ruptga-centered religion of Hammerfell, the Yokudans still hold Sakatal in higher steem due to his role in creation and his cyclical nature. The Yokudan creation myth involved Sep, a "crazy" merchant god who convinced the others to create the mortal world to make it easier for more spirits to survive Satakal's inevitable onslaught. Except it didn't make it easier. Rather, the mortal plane acts as a trap and makes apotheosis even harder. In this way, the Redguard view of creation has more in common with the Elven tradition than that of other humans, who view the mortal plane as a blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sixth_house_DESC;The Sixth House, or Great House Dagoth, was one of the ancient Great Houses or Tribes of the Dunmer, but following the events of the Battle of Red Mountain, it has since fallen into obscurity in general society and become something of a mythological horror story. The true facts of the House's fall will never be known, but it is believed that the House's leader, and perhaps founder, Voryn Dagoth, a close friend of the Hortator, Lord Nerevar Indoril, wished to at first destroy Kagrenac's Tools, but while Nerevar was consulting with his other advisors on their course of action, Dagoth began studying the tools and by some unknown incident was changed into what we know as "Dagoth Ur". Under this guise, he sought to use the tools to steal the power of the Heart for himself.  Nerevar and his advisors fought in a great battle against Dagoth Ur and his followers, driving him deep beneath Red Mountain.  There, beneath the Heart, deep within that volcano, Dagoth Ur waits for his chance to rise again, and his House, the Sixth House, have in recent times taken on a cult-like, religious aspect, with his followers awaiting his return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

winter_wind_mod;Follower of the Winter Wind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
winter_wind_DESC;The Winter Wind is a death cult that gained traction amongst the Kamal during their early days settling the frozen south of Akavir. The people began to worship strange undead creatures that came in the night during the violent blizzards of the southern land's "winters".In return for the "gifts" they provided to these creatures they were granted a form of immortality and a measure of immunity to the biting cold of their new home. The growth of this cult led to a violent civil war amongst the Kamal Tribes, and the cult was burned out of Kamal society during a great purge. Though the "Snow Demons" were never heard of again, some worshippers at least survived and the cult persists, hidden within Kamal Society though changed to a form of ancestor worship, with a perhaps an unhealthy dose of necromancy involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

pilgrimage_emblem_1;After a small trip, you reach the first Emblem: "Before the birth of men, the Dragons ruled all Mundus.  Their word was the Voice, and they spoke only for True Needs.  For the Voice could blot out the sky and flood the land."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_1_fail;As if the Gods didn't want you to progress, your entourage is faced with a roadslide and, after a heated discussion, decides to go back home. You can't deny Nature's wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

apilgrimage.AltInfo;This option is available beause of a qualifying attribute score or personal trait. This option will always succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_11;As you climb the steps, you notice several grey shapes darting through the trees beside the pathway. They emerge, their teeth bared--wolves! The beasts snarl at you, inching forward as they prepare to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.11Combat;Die, beasts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.11Alt;I'll scare the wolves away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_12;The wolves are fearsome but are no match for you, and are quickly dispatched. You continue up the Seven Thousand Steps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.12.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_13;The wolves surround you. You are able to kill one, but a second wolf grabs you by your leg from behind. It pulls you down, as the rest of the wolves seize the opportunity to maul you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.13.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_14;You open your arms, stretching them out as far as you can and making an awful commotion. The wolves cautiously back way before fleeting, giving you the opportunity to pass unassailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.14.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_16;Continuing along, you come across a camp of people armed to the teeth. They draw their weapons and approach. "You picked a bad time to get lost, friend," one of them says. "We'll be taking your belongings. And your life. Get 'em, boys!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.16Combat;"I'll mount your heads on my wall!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.16Alt;"Oh, you're the leader? I heard you were getting replaced by sunrise!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_17;The bandits talk big, but their fighting skills aren't enough to keep them alive against you. After killing the last one, you continue along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.17.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_18;All of the bandits charge at you at once. You try to fight back, but one is able to slip behind you and puts a knife up against your throat. "Now's the part where you fall down and BLEED to death!" the bandit exclaims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.18.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_19;The bandit leader is bemused and turns to his underlings to question if your claim is true. Try as they might to calm him down, he doesn't believe them and flies into a rage, stabbing one of them. Soon, the bandit gang breaks into a free-for-all as they try to kill one another, forgetting about you entirely. You simply stroll by the carnage and continue along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.19.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_21;You come to a break in the pathway where the steps are uncomfortably icy. As you keep your eyes on your footing, you hear a huge roar in front of you. A vicious snow bear is not even a dozen steps away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.21Combat;"I've fought mudcrabs more fearsome than you!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.21Alt;A bear that big won't move very well on ice like this, if I just evade it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_22;As strong as the bear is, its slow speed makes it easy to outmaneuver. You dodge a swipe from one of its paws and deliver a strike that kills the bear almost instantly, and continue on your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.22.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_23;You attempt to dodge a swipe from one of the bear's massive paws, but it catches you in the abdomen. The force of the blow sends you reeling and you lose your footing, before tumbling off the side of the mountain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.23.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_24;You face the bear, keeping a low center of gravity. Suddenly, you make a dash to the left, to the side of the path adjacent to a drop. The bear lunges forward, but you juke back to the right. The bear not only misses you entirely, but loses its footing and plummets off of the mountain. Carefully, you continue your journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.24.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_26;What started as a modest snowfall rapidly picks up, the winds reach howling conditions and the air becomes chillingly cold. A blizzard has commenced!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.26Combat;I can handle a snowstorm! I'm sure of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.26Alt;Ah, how I love this brisk Skyrim weather! It's invigorating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_27;The blizzard is agonizing, but you fight through it and eventually, it lets up, allowing you to continue with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.27.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_28;You attempt to fight your way through the blizzard, trudging along. But the effects of hypothermia begin to set in, and you gradually lose consciousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.28.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_29;Despite the frigidity of the weather, your body's resistance to the harsh cold negates these ill effects. Eventually, the blizzard lets up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.29.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_31;You arrive at a camp consisting of a single tent and a weak campfire. A lone individual is huddled nearby, muttering something incomprehensible. The person notices you and stands up, screaming furiously. "Back off! Away! Go!" they yell. "So...so sick. Sick. Feel bad, warm but cold. Head...my head. Go away! AWAY!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.31Combat;"Die, fiend!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.31Alt;"You look ill, maybe I can help you?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_32;The maniac rushes forward, flailing their arms. This does them little good as you eliminate them and continue your pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.32.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_33;The gibbering lunatic charges at you, flailing their arms wildly. Before you can even draw a weapon to attack, they push you right off the mountain, and both of you plunge to your deaths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.33.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_34;The maniac seems terrified, but calms down as you approach them with a potion of cure disease. After a few moments, the person thanks you. "I left Ivarstead a few weeks ago and was bitten by a skeever before I reached the first emblem! I should have turned back...but thank you for saving my life!" You and the pilgrim head in opposite directions as you continue up the mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.34.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_36;What starts as a few pebbles and stones from higher up on the mountain quickly transforms into a full-blown rockslide that threatens to crush you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.36Combat;These are just rocks, and rocks can be broken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.36Alt;I should be able to maneuver around these.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_37;Large stones and boulders fall all around you, but none are able to actually hit you. The ones that get close are shattered into tiny pieces by well-timed attacks. Soon, the rockslide is behind you, and you continue along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.37.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_38;You try to move along, breaking up any rocks that fall near you with well-timed attacks. However, one particularly large boulder does not break right away, and lands right atop your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.38.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_39;Despite the dangers of the rockslide, you manage to simply avoid any incoming debris and soon enough, the rockslide is far behind you and you are safe to continue your journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.39.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_41;In a clearing against the face of the mountain, you notice a group of robed men and women raising skeletons and frozen corpses. One of them notices you in turn, and soon, the entire group of necromancers and their thralls approaches you, ready for a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.41Combat;"Fall before me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.41Alt;"I'm not here to stop any of you. You leave me alone, and I'll leave you alone.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_42;The necromancers' magicks and undead warriors do not stand a chance against you, as you slay them one by one. Their thralls collapse into dust, and you resume your ascent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.42.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_43;You charge into battle, but find yourself overwhelmed by the undead thralls, and the necromancers bombard you with destruction spells that quickly end your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.43.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_44;The necromancers confer with each other for a moment and one steps forward. "Very well," the mage says. "We have nothing more to discuss. Be on your way." You continue along the steps, and the necromancers resume their magickal activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.44.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_46;Just after you walk past the eighth emblem, a shadowy individual stands in the middle of the path, blocking your way. "Halt!" they cry. "I see too many pilgrims who think they can just climb the Seven Thousand Steps and meet the Greybeards. They're wrong, and I bet you are too! I bet you didn't even bother to remember what the previous emblems said, word-for-word!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.46Combat;"Die, fool!";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.46Alt;"Actually, I remember exactly what they said! Let me recite them...";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_47;The zealot draws a warhammer and charges headlong, ready for battle. They clearly underestimated your skills, as you kill them with a few simple attacks, and continue along the path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.47.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_48;The zealot draws a warhammer and charges headlong at you. They catch you with a glancing blow that knocks you off your feet, and they pull the hammer straight up into the air before delivering a crushing blow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.48.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_49;A few minutes pass as you recite each prior emblem. The zealot appears thoroughly impressed and steps aside. "Not often do I see someone who takes this so seriously. Sorry, friend. Good luck on your journey!" You exchange farewells and continue the pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.49.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_51;As you climb the steps, you hear a fearsome bellow and see a shaggy, white-haired biped atop a crag in the distance. It is a frost troll! It stands above the only path leading to High Hrothgar, eager to fight you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.51Combat;I will slay this beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.51Alt;Why fight it when I can simply evade it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_52;The troll stamps its feet as you rush towards it, and jumps down to face you. It swings a massive arm, which you dodge underneath, landing an attack to the back of the neck that kills the troll where it stands. You continue your pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.52.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_53;As you rush towards the troll, it leaps down to face you. It swings a massive arm which you attempt to dodge underneath, but it manages to catch you on the side of the head. Your vision goes blurry as you see another massive arm swing at you, and you cannot even try to dodge this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.53.Acknowledge;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_54;The troll stamps its feet as you rush along the path, and jumps down to meet you. Before it can even attack, you've already run behind it and you continue hurrying up the steps. Too slow to chase you, the troll simply gives up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.54.Acknowledge;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.55.Continue;I shall visit the Greybeards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage.55.End;It would be wrong to disturb the Greybeards. Time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_2;After climbing more steps, you see the second Emblem: "Men were born and spread over the face of Mundus.  The Dragons presided over the crawling masses.  Men were weak then, and had no Voice."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_2_fail;As your group is in their tents trying to get some sleep, you hear what seems to be a bear's roar. In a matter of seconds all your entourage gets up and starts running in horror from the terrifying sounds. You don't quite see the bear, but you flee with your group nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_3;You soon reach the third Emblem: "The fledgling spirits of Men were strong in Old Times, Unafraid to war with Dragons and their Voices, But the Dragons only shouted them down and broke their hearts."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_3_fail;Your group is walking towards the fourth Emblem when, all of sudden, shadows jump from the trees and round up everyone, taking gold and precious goods. It seems your group just got robbed by mountain bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_4;Ice becomes less of a hazard as the steps that follow, along with the mountain itself, are covered in snow. Soon, you see the fourth Emblem: "Kyne called on Paarthurnax, who pitied Man.  Together they taught Men to use the Voice.  Then Dragon War raged, Dragon against Tongue."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_4_fail;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] be dammed! A huge wall of snow has formed between the fourth and fifth Emblems and prevents your passage.  After blaming you for all of it, your entourage climbs back down the mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_5;You arrive at the fifth Emblem: "Man prevailed, shouting Alduin out of the world, Proving for all that their Voice too was strong, Although their sacrifices were many-fold."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_5_fail;Before you could even begin to defend yourself, a pack of wolves coming down the mountain starts to attack your unprepared group.  Even though you think leaving the fat boy behind as prey was kind of selfish, your group makes it to Ivarstead alive.  Most of it anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_6;Soon, you see the sixth Emblem: "With roaring Tongues, the Sky-Children conquer, Founding the First Empire with Sword and Voice, Whilst the Dragons withdrew from this World."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_6_fail;Your group has almost reached the seventh Emblem, when senile old men clad in strange robes approach your group.  As they draw near, they reveal themselves to be rogue mages and demand high sums of gold to let your group make it down alive.  You pay the ransom and take your leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_7;Continuing on, you reach the seventh Emblem: "The Tongues at Red Mountain went away humbled, Jurgen Windcaller began His Seven Year Meditation To understand how Strong Voices could fail."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_7_fail;What started as a small snowstorm has turned out to be a huge blizzard!  You almost lose your group amidst the snow as you start to climb down the mountain.  Maybe this is a sign from [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_8;You pause for a few moments to read the eighth Emblem: "Jurgen Windcaller chose silence and returned. The 17 disputants could not shout Him down.  Jurgen the Calm built His home on the Throat of the World.".\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_8_fail;Your group is passing a narrow rocky passage when a Frost Troll jumps on you! Your entourage grabs you by the arm and starts running down the mountain.  No one beats a Troll, specially a Frost Troll!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_9;Your journey is almost complete. You reach the ninth Emblem: "For years all silent, the Greybeards wait to speak one name, who will be recognized as Dovahkiin."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_9_fail;As your group approach High Hrothgar's temple, they see another group coming down the mountain.  Night is coming and you decide to camp with them.  It is therefore a surprise when you wake up half-naked, with all your things stolen.  The other group is nowhere to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_ivarstead;After a few days travelling on a small carriage with your pilgrim entourage, you finally arrived at Ivarstead. As you look to High Hrothgar you are humbled and realize how accurate the nickname "Throat of the World" is. The inhabitants of Ivarstead warn you about snowstorms, wolves, bears and all kinds of disasters that could happen on your way up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_10;Tall towers of stone jut out from the mountainside. You have reached High Hrothgar, and stop read the final Emblem: "The Voice is worship. Follow the Inner path. Speak only in True Need."\n\n Will you go up or end your pilgrimage here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_10_fail;You knock on their door. No one answers. You do it again. No one answers. You knock again and again and again until everyone in your entourage gets sick of your self-humiliation and convinces you to just go back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_10_greybeards_old;You knock on their door. No one answers. You do it again. An old bearded man opens the door and, in a whisper, invites in your group for a good cup of tea.  After hours and hours of "whispering" and tea, you round up your supplies and climb down the mountain. It was an epic journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_10_greybeards;You enter High Hrothgar. In this dimly-lit building, a figure in a hooded robe approaches you. They whisper, inviting you to meditate in the solitude of the monastery for a time. After a hours and hours of meditation, you realize that you have learned a great deal, and round up your supplies and return down the mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_10_greybeards_supreme;You enter High Hrothgar. In this dimly-lit building, a figure in a hooded robe approaches you. They whisper that you are perhaps the one that the Greybeards, have been waiting for. After hours of meditation with the Greybeards, you are given the opportunity to learn the Way of the Voice, and the Thuum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

apilgrimage.56.End;This was an incredible journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apilgrimage_57;After weeks of study and training, you have realized your potential and acquired the ability to wield the Thuum. The Greybeards advise you to use your gift wisely, and recommend that you follow the Way of the Voice to avert any possible corruption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

apilgrimage.57.TheWay;"Breath and focus.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pilgrimage_emblem_10_thuum;You knock on their door. No one answers. You do it again. An old shaved men opens the door.  He tells you he is sick of the peaceful Greybeards and wants to share their knowledges with someone.  You let your entourage go back home as you need days of practice and meditation be able to use your natural Thu'um..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
