EVTDESCekevmisc1a;It's been some time since I've last felt the influence of my Prince... And yet, now, in their absence, I hear the faint whispers of another... It seems I have a choice to make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc1b;Recently, I've felt a calling in the back of my mind. A presence, sinister and treacherous, promising great power... I had considered it a hallucination at first, nothing more than an idle thought caused by lack of sleep, but the presence persists... promising power and fortune, to those who would serve it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc1opta1;If my Prince has abandoned me, I will forsake them as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc1opta2;"Power overwhelming"... Now that has a very nice ring to it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc1optb1;Though my Prince has forsaken me, I doubt my betrayal would be forgiven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc1optb2;Perhaps, with further research in the privacy of my libraries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc1optc1;I am a loyal servant of my Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc1optc2;As a siren they would lure me to my doom. I will not be seduced!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc2;While travelling your demesne, an interesting object catches your eye not far off the road. It may be something as mundane as a peasant's misplaced farming tool, but what if it isn't...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc2opt1;This warrants further investigation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc2opt2;No, objects at the roadside don't concern me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc3;As you lift the object to take a closer look, it crumbles to dust in your hand! It was a trap! A demonic yet somehow quite pathetic voice echoes from behind you - "While you were out arranging betrothals, I studied the blade!" the shout came. You turn about to see a rather portly katana-wielding Dremora, and he seems to be waddling right for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc3opt1;"DIE! DIE! DIE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc4;Upon closer inspection, it appears the object that caught your eye was none other than a nest of extremely territorial enchanted hornets! You're in for it now, buddy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc4opt1;"[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] preserve me...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc4opt2;"Trifling bees! Tremble before the power of a Tongue!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc4opt3;Wait... what's that noise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5a;You immediately turn to flee, heading off as quickly as you can. Whether you truly outran the apian assailants or they just lost interest is of little matter to you - you're safe, and unscathed. Perhaps next time, you think, you'll reconsider investigating strange objects at the side of the road...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5b;You turn to flee and manage to escape the majority of the swarm, but a small portion persistently stays on your trail, delivering a few harsh stings before you successfully lose them. In retrospect, maybe grabbing strange objects at the roadside was not your most well-thought-out plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5c;Realizing you stand no chance against this magically-enhanced menace, you turn to flee and take off as fast as you can, but the bees are persistent and harry you the entire way. Upon returning home, your personal physician takes one look at you and sighs, heading off to fetch his instruments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5d;You turn to flee, but your foot gets caught on a root, sending you crashing to the ground as the swarm of hornets wash over you, stinging every part of your body imaginable. You have nothing left to do but count the stings as they are inflicted. 998... 999... and suddenly, the world goes dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5e;You smirk as the bees seek to challenge you, and triumphantly place your hands upon your hips. "Go ahead and sting me, bees!" you shout, "I'm immune!" and it certainly appears to be true - the stings of the fearsome hornets do little more than tickle you, probably owing to the sting you once experienced as a child. This day, you are victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5f;Or, at least, you would be, if they did not appear to be quite docile... You open your pack, and the swarm of hornets flies in, seemingly claiming your bag as its new nest. That went far better than you expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5g;"FUS... RO DAH!" you shout, the dragontongue reverberating throughout the air as the bees are scattered and torn apart by the sheer force of your imposing voice. You're sure that whoever enchanted this hornet's nest did not count on a tongue of your caliber coming across it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5h;"FUS... RO DAH!" you shout, the dragontongue reverberating throughout the air as the bees are scattered and torn apart by the sheer force of your imposing voice. You're sure that whoever enchanted this hornet's nest did not count on a tongue of your caliber coming across it - and what's more, you seem to have found something they were guarding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5i;"KHRYA-YA-YA-YA" comes the call, and in the blink of an eye your pet badger has placed itself between you and the threat! The swarm hesitates, and your badger charges, scattering the bees and chasing them off, leaving the nest unoccupied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5j;"KHRYA-YA-YA-YA" comes the call, and in the blink of an eye your pet badger has placed itself between you and the threat! The swarm hesitates, and your badger charges, scattering the bees and chasing them off, leaving the nest unoccupied. Taking another look, you notice a treasure the nest seemed to be guarding. Well, it's yours now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5k;You raise an eyebrow as you draw your own blade, easily parrying your opponent's blow and driving a counter straight for his oversized gut, plunging through it like a hot knife through butter - wait, is that actually butter? No matter - you clean your blade off as the Dremora fades back to oblivion, leaving behind only his sword - black and red, of course. You shrug, slinging it over your shoulder and taking it home with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5l;The aggressive waddling of your opponent takes you offguard, but you nonetheless draw steel, catching his first blow and beginning an earnest duel. You two go back and forth, both scoring hits on eachother, but eventually your opponent begins to pant. You've outlasted him! You go in for the kill, striking him down and sending him back to Oblivion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5m;The large and quite hairy dremora collides with you, sending you falling to the ground. You roll out of the way of his blade, but get caught on one of its many spikes, grievously injuring you. He stops suddenly, opening his mouth and beginning to gloat. "Such is the fate of all of those who stand against COLDSTEEL THE DREMORA," he begins, but has no time to continue before your blade finds its way into his throat, ending his short moment of triumph. You sigh and head home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCekevmisc5n;Your reflexes are somehow even slower than your opponent's, and he effortlessly (though quite sluggishly) slashes his blade across your chest, leaving you grievously wounded. As you move to draw your own blade, one of his blade's many spikes impales your wrist before he wimpily kicks you to the ground. Standing over you, he smirks. "Nothing personal, kid..." the Dremora mutters, plunging his blade through your chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt1;It could've been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt2;My reputation will suffer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt3;Argh... it hurts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt4;A crossbow bolt would've been quicker...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt5;Haha, I'm not even in the F-Bee-I, stupid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt6;I will show them all what the buzz is about!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt7;If only I could solve all my problems this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt8;I hope it's a cough-drop...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt9;You just do what you want, hm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt10;Let's get that loot and head home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt11;Ow! That's a really sharp edge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt12;I'd rather not even think about that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt13;To think I was almost defeated in such a way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc5opt14;Darkness envelops me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement0desc;As [Root.GetName] is properly [Root.Culture.GetName] as we are, we have elected to cease any and all crimes against the local populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement1desc;As [Root.GetName] is not of our culture, we have disestablished the efforts of the previous administration to resettle it with the [Root.Culture.GetName] people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement2desc;We have scattered the few remaining inhabitants of [Root.GetName] and replaced them with our own settlers. [Root.GetName] is now [Root.Holder.Culture.GetName] territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement3desc;Our efforts against the [Root.Culture.GetName] people of [Root.GetName] have been halted due to the province having fallen into the hands of our enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement20desc;Our magistrates have drawn up a plan to begin assimilating [From.GetName] - shall we give the order?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement20opta;Resistance is futile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement25desc;Long hours of consulting with our shamans have resulted in a plan for spreading the Hist to [Root.GetName]. They simply need the word - and some supplies - and they will begin our terraforming efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement25opta;Springtime for [Root.Holder.PrimaryTitle.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement26desc;Through considerable time and effort, the Hist has successfully colonized [Root.GetName]. With steady waves of colonists moving in, it is safe to say that [Root.GetName] is effectively [Root.Culture.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement30desc;Our forces are standing by to drive out the [From.Culture.GetName] people of [From.GetName]. They will, of course, not be pleased, and are unlikely to take this passively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement30opta;What will they do? Bleed on us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement40desc;Our forces have marched through the night to arrive on the outskirts of [From.GetName]. An uneasy sense of trepidation coats the air like a thick slime. A collection of locals have assembled, demanding to know the meaning of this intrusion. But from the haggard looks in their eyes, it would appear that this was not unexpected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement40opta;Wipe them out. All of them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement31desc;The expulsion of the locals of [Root.GetName] has been completed, and rather uneventfully at that. If you are so inclined, my [Root.Owner.GetTitle], the province is now open to resettlement by our own citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement32desc;The expulsion of the locals of [Root.GetName] has been completed, and if you are so inclined, my [Root.Owner.GetTitle], the province is now open to resettlement by our own citizens. However - a large group of the disaffected have taken up arms against us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement42desc;The massacre of the locals of [Root.GetName] has been largely completed, their homes burnt and people put to the sword. While the province is now open to resettlement, a large group of survivors have formed a resistance against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement50desc;The province of [Root.GetName], whether by our hand or another's, is left bereft of a sustainable population. We could wait for it to repopulate naturally, or we could take some measures to accelerate the process...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement50opta;Some minor investment may speed things along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement50optb;A moderate investment would be a bigger help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement50optc;A major investment is the right decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement50optd;These things must happen naturally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement60desc;Our magistrates estimate that an investment of half a year's income should reduce the amount of time it would take to resettle [From.GetName] by about a quarter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement60opta;Half a year's income? A small price to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement70desc;Our magistrates estimate that an investment of three-quarters of a year's income should reduce the amount of time it would take to resettle [From.GetName] by about half.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement70opta;Three-quarters of a year's income... This better be worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement90desc;It's been some time since our settlers first broke ground in [Root.GetName] with the aim of rebuilding a flourishing populace, and today their efforts yield fruit. A courier from the local administration has arrived, informing us that they believe the population is again sustainable and the economy has healed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekevmisc6desc;The library brims with hundreds of tomes on just as many subjects, surely collected over a long period of time by its caretakers. You find a book that catches your eye, and take it to the counter. "Why, yes, we would be willing to part with this book for a time... Provided, of course, that you make a small donation in return...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc6opta;A small price to pay for knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekevmisc6optc;I want a book that I can keep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekevmisc7desca;After intense study and careful research, you think you may have learned something after all. You take the book and head back to the library, placing the book on the counter. You glance back to the shelves - after all, there's so much more to learn...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc7descb;Many sleepless nights you've spent trying to make sense of the book you acquired from that library, and many sleepless nights you've yielded nothing to show for it. With a sigh, you bring the book back to the library, and consider getting another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekevmisc7opta;Hmm, what about that one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekevmisc7optb;No, I've learned enough for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekevmisc8desc;The curator raises an eyebrow at you. "Certainly..." he says, his voice laden with thinly-veiled disdain.

custgovts395desc;Couriers have been dispatched to all corners of Tamriel with news from the Imperial Isle - the Commune is dead, and in its place the new Imperial Republic rises. With power wrested away from the old Imperial Elite, the Republic discards the old fetters of the Commune, now limited only by their ambition and their rivals. It is a glorious day for Cyrodiil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
custgovts395opta;What will happen from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

custgovts396desc;With the Imperial Isle and the Imperial City with it falling into the hands of an enemy realm, the administrative institutions that make up our government can no longer function. The old Imperial Elite are displaced, their institutions dislodged, and their grasp of power broken. The remnants of the Elder Council no longer hold any sway over the realm, discarding the legacy of the old Reman Dynasty and the Akaviri Potentate. Our destiny is our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
custgovts396opta;Dark days are upon us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

custgovts397desc;You've done it! Your achievements are certain to rival the old Emperors themselves! Having (or having mostly) united Cyrodiil, you have largely brought an end to the infighting in the Imperial Province, and your rule is unquestioned. The people of Cyrodiil look to you, to guide them into a bright new age without the shackles of those who sought to mimic Elder Council holding you back. You have work to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
custgovts397opta;This day is a glorious one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement111desc;Throughout your time ruling [Root.Realm.GetName], you've done many questionable things, and ordered even more. The legacy of the atrocities you leave behind you seems to have left a lasting impact on your personality, and you can no longer consider yourself the caring soul you once were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement111opta;Artificial moral concepts merely get in the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement112desc;The trails of blood and death you leave behind you as you consign thousands to death at the mark of a pen have called into question your concept of justice. While you once may have been considered a great ruler, fair and feared, fear is now the only thing left to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement112opta;And who are they to judge my leadership?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement113desc;The time it would take, you've realized, to peacefully assimilate the conquered cultures to follow [Root.Culture.GetName] customs is unacceptable in your eyes. Why teach when you can simply kill, expel, and replace? The means do not matter to you, simply the ends, and the ends must be reached as fast as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement113opta;Who ever said patience was a virtue?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement114desc;Lately, you've found it hard to sit peacefully upon your throne. A constant nagging feeling in the back of your mind preventing you from being at ease - the pervasive knowledge that blood is on your hands. You will have to learn to deal with this feeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement114opta;This does not bode well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement115desc;While walking through a smoldering village razed at your order, a sight catches your eye - an emaciated mother, huddling amongst the ashes and ruins with her young child. Only the trails of tears break the ash upon her face. You maintain eye-contact for a brief moment, eventually sighing and walking on. Their fates, after all, are of no consequence to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement115opta;Charity is for fools and wastrels anyways...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement116desc;Laying waste to entire populations certainly leaves a [Root.GetManWoman] with no shortage of enemies. You are finding it harder and harder to trust people these days - anyone upon your streets could be a disaffected survivor, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement116opta;Trust is weakness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement117desc;Your actions have shown your lack of patience for things taking their natural course. You, rather, are inclined to speed up a lengthy process - at swordpoint. No cost too great, no consequence too grave. If there is something in this world you desire, you have determined you will have it. By any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement117opta;They will yet learn to fear my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement118desc;Your patience has worn increasingly thin since you've set down the path of conquest. Your courtiers avoid you for fear of invoking your hair-triggered wrath, and your subjects live wary of whatever you might inflict upon them in your anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement118opta;I have no tolerance for such foolishness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement119desc;You've come to the conclusion that, perhaps, you quite enjoy the suffering you inflict upon others. The burnt corpses and homes your armies leave behind them are monuments to the achievements of your indomitable will, and serve as a statement - all who oppose you will share such a fate. You smile, content with this knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekresettlement119opta;Nobody would dare cross me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekresettlement120desc;While walking through the corridors of your hall, a low noise grabs your attention. Quiet at first, but progressively increasing in volume.
