### Events
reach_flavour.1.t;High Kingdom of the Reach;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.1.d;For centuries the lands of the Reach have been without a powerful leader, or any kind of policital unity. Bretons and Nords, backed by Imperial armies, carved the Reach and made sure that it would not be a threat to their power ever again.\nNevertheless, these lands have been inhabited by Reachmen and Orcs, people who, without a home to call theirs, made the Reach a fertile ground for ambitious rulers and people.\n[Root.GetTitledName] is one of these people, and in a powerful move officially proclaimed the High Kingdom of the Reach, centuries after Reman carved it.\nThe Reach is now as strong politically as High Rock, Skyrim, or Cyrodiil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.1.optA;Hopefully this will bring peace and stability to a troubled region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REACH_FLAVOUR_DE_JURE_REACH_CT;The Reach will be its own de Jure Kingdom.\n\nAs long as the de Jure Reach exists, the Nordic and Breton Empire cannot be formed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.2.d;[From.GetTitledName], in a strong political move, officially proclaimed the High Kingdom of the Reach, taking lands that were given to High Rock and Skyrim by Reman and giving them back their own identity.\nWhat will happen next is uncertain, but the Reach is now as strong politically as High Rock, Skyrim, or even Cyrodiil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.2.optA;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ec_vote_de_jure_reach;Create a de Jure Kingdom of the Reach;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reach_flavour.9.d;[From.GetTitledName] has vetoed the proceedings of the Elder Council in the middle of its debate concerning creating a de Jure Kingdom of the Reach, preventing the motion from coming into law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.10.t;Faolan Reborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.10.d;When the Alessian Empire invaded the Reach, a prophesied child, said to unite the chiefs of the Reach and fight the Imperials, was found and named Faolan, "Red Eagle".\nThe Kings of the Reach who did not yet fall under the Imperial forces joined the Red Eagle, but even that was not enough.\nOut of desperation, Faolan became the first Briarheart, and fought the Imperial forces by himself, killing hundreds of them until being killed.\nCenturies later, the Reman Empire struck another blow, partitioning the Reach in two parts, awarded to Skyrim and High Rock.\nLegends say that when the Reach was finally free, the sword of Faolan was to be brought to his corpse, so he could rise from the dead and lead his people.\n[Root.GetTitledName] did so, and, infused with the spirit of the Briarhearts, was proclaimed Faolan reborn, the new Red Eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.10.optA;We will never kneel again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REACHMEN_FAOLAN_BLOODLINE_NAMED_FAOLAN;Reachmen Emperors sharing the Red Eagle's bloodline will be named Faolan, while Reachmen Empresses will be named Melka.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.11.d;The Reach was without a king or unity for centuries, ever since the Red Eagle was defeated by the Imperial forces. But the Reachmen have found a new leader to follow, who united their lands with a flaming sword, forced the other powers of Tamriel to see them as equals, and some even say their chief struck an alliance with the Hagravens.\nAll of that made the Reachmen proclaim this chief as the new Red Eagle, as Faolan reborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.12.t;The Hagravens Coven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.12.d.1;As you place your offering, a dark figure emerge and approaches you.\n"Your dedication to the ancient rites has been noticed. Tell me, what do you seek? There must be something that you want, deep inside your heart. Is it power? Fame? Something else? We are powerful. There is much we can do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.12.d.2;As you place your offering, a dark figure emerge and approaches you.\n"It is quite unusual for a [Root.GetTitle] of the Reachmen to travel this far. Tell me, what do you seek? There must be something that you want, deep inside your heart. Is it power? Fame? Something else? We are powerful. There is much we can do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.12.optA;I heard about your... Dark powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HAGRAVEN_POWERS_OFFERING_CT;The Hagravens have many secrets. They could share some of them with you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.12.optB;I am here to seek an alliance between the Reach and the Hagravens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HAGRAVEN_ALLIANCE_OFFERING_CT;Some of the Reach leaders seeked an alliance with the Hagravens, as they are highly respected throughout the Reach. However, they will probably require... Something, in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.12.optC;There isn't anything I need, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.13.d;The Hagraven smiles and raise a hand.\n"Yes, we can offer that. As you know, countless warriors tried to give us their heart in exchange for powers. And countless witches asked us to teach them our secrets and turn them into what we are. But not all survived in the process. While it can give you untold powers and eternal life, you will suffer greatly in the process. And probably die. Are you sure you want this?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.13.optA;I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CEREMONY_SURVIVAL_DEPENDS_ON_HEALTH_CT;The ceremony will put your body under extreme stress and pain. Your survival chance depends on your health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRIARHEART_HAGRAVEN_FORCED_RELIGION_CT;Should you survive the process, you would be forced to stay a Hagraven cultist. Changing your religion would kill you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.13.optB;That sounds a bit too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.14.d.1;The Hagraven raises a brow.\n"An alliance? They might call you '[Root.GetTitle] of the Reachmen', but the last one we truly followed was Faolan, after he traded his heart and bounded his then dark heart with Melka. Before we can talk about an alliance, you will need to offer your soul and body to our magic.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.14.d.2;"As you already have given your heart and soul to the Reach, I suppose the legacy of Faolan lives through you."\nThe Hagraven then raises a claw.\n"But Faolan did not just give his heart. He also binded his dark heart and soul to Melka, a Hagraven. Would you be ready to do the same, casting aside your mortal spouse if you have one?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.14.optA;Take my heart and soul, make me a [Root.GetHagravenBriarheart].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.14.optB;I will bind myself to a [generated_briarheart_hagraven.GetHagravenBriarheart].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HAGRAVEN_VASSALIZED_CT;The High Crone will become your vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HAGRAVEN_ALLIANCE_SEALED_CT;An alliance with the Hagravens will be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.14.optC;The price might be too high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NEED_500_PIETY_CT;You need 500 piety to go through the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NEED_1000_PIETY_CT;You need 1000 piety to go through the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.15.d.1;"Hearts of thorn... bones of the wild... in life, Reachmen... rise from death, Blood of our Blood.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.15.d.2;"Beak, feathers, claws. Dark magic, limitless knowledge, savage powers. Your human form is weak, cast it aside and join the Hagravens.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reach_flavour.15.optA;"My heart and soul for the Reach.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
