assassination431;Without warning, [mt_murder_target.GetFirstName] turns around. [mt_murder_target.GetSheHeCap] dodges my attack and draws a weapon, and we do battle.

assassination431accept;That was close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
assassination432;Quiet evenings like this are few and far in between. I finally have--wait! Out of the corner of my eye I see a figure lunging toward me and turn around.

ekthieving362a;Another quiet evening. How peaceful. After writing a few letters and going over some paperwork, I hear a commotion in one of the adjacent rooms. I draw my weapon and enter, only to see one of my guards standing over top an unconscious [From.GetBestName]. "Saw this one rifling through your things, didn't like the look on [From.GetHerHim]," the guard declares. It's a good thing I have so many patrols on duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekthieving362b;Whatever [From.GetBestName] was planning when [From.GetSheHe] entered my estate, it probably didn't involve my patrols catching wind of [From.GetHerHis] arrival. When the fool entered my quarters, we sprung the trap and ensured that there would be no way to evade capture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekthieving370a;While perusing my personal belongings, I noticed that my [ek_theft_target_object.GetName] is missing! I ask everyone at court if they saw it, but they all claim to know absolutely nothing about its whereabouts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekthieving370b;Another quiet evening. How peaceful. After writing a few letters and going over some paperwork, I stop to take a look out the window and gaze upon my beautiful domain below.

ekthieving370accept;I've been robbed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekthieving380a;Late at night, I arrive at where [ek_theft_target_owner.GetFirstName] is said to be keeping [ek_theft_target_owner.GetHerHis] [ek_theft_target_object.GetName]. Sneaking past the outer defences, I make my way into the inner chambers and locate my objective. I snatch it and make a hasty exit before anyone notices that I was here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekthieving380accept;Ha! The [ek_theft_target_object.GetName] is mine!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekthieving390;The death of [From.GetBestName] has resulted in [From.GetHerHis] personal belongings being relocated. The Camonna Tong will need to re-evaluate and plan another heist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
