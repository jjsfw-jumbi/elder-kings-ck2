altmer_become_pure_desc;Go on a holiday in Alinor to attain or regain familiarity with Altmer culture and customs. Afterwards, board of esteemed Sapiarchs will evaluate your Altmeri qualities through five tests, one for each of your Attributes. If you are successful, you will be recognised as a Pure Altmer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer1;How vile! That disgusting mongrel [target_impure_courtier.GetFirstName] is a stain on the purity of all [target_impure_courtier.GetHerHis] fellow Altmer! Maybe some public shaming will show [target_impure_courtier.GetHerHim] who the superior one is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer1Accept;Tell my whole court what a disgrace [target_impure_courtier.GetFirstName] is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer1Decline;I see no need to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer2;How vile! That disgusting mongrel [target_impure_vassal.GetFirstName] is a stain on the purity of all [target_impure_vassal.GetHerHis] fellow Altmer! Maybe some public shaming will show them [target_impure_vassal.GetHerHim] who the superior one is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer2Accept;Tell my whole court what a disgrace [target_impure_vassal.GetFirstName] is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer2Decline;I see no need to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer5;[From.GetBestName] just berated me in front of dozens of others for my impurity! I wanted to defend myself, but I know the truth. I am Impure, and there is no excusing this burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer5Acknowledge;Oh, the humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer10;I spend a great deal of time with my wonderful friend [target_impure_friend.GetFirstName], but I am hearing murmurs that our fraternisation is a stain upon my purity. My subjects expect me to do something to remedy this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer10Accept;End my friendship with [target_impure_friend.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer10Decline;[target_impure_friend.GetFirstName] is my friend and that is final!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer10Purify;Maintain my purity with a cleansing ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer15;[From.GetFirstName] informed me that due to my impurity, we can no longer be friends lest it soil [From.GetHerHis] own purity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer15Acknowledge;Why, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer20;I spend a great deal of time with my love, [target_impure_lover.GetFirstName], but I am hearing murmurs that our relationship is a stain upon my purity. My subjects expect me to do something to remedy this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer20Accept;End my relationship with [target_impure_lover.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer20Decline;[target_impure_lover.GetFirstName] is the love of my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Altmer25;[From.GetFirstName] informed me that due to my impurity, we can no longer be in a relationship with one another, lest it soil [From.GetHerHis] own purity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer25Acknowledge;After all we have been through, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer50;I have been away from Alinor for such a long time. Recently, my courtiers started mentioning that my attire, my speech, my mannerisms and even my smell seem less like what befits a true, high-born Altmer and more like what they would expect to find in a lowly Man or Beast! Maybe a holiday back home would benefit me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer50Accept;I will travel to Alinor, the home of my ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer50Decline;There is nothing wrong with how I am!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer51;Verdant hillsides, abundant fruit orchards and awe-inspiring towers serve as the backdrop to a reinvigorating experience! I am treated to calligraphy and sculpting classes, baths in hot springs, delicious Altmeri cuisine and tours of ancient shrines and palaces. I return home, feeling like a true Altmer and my courtiers inform me that my purity is inspiring to all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer51Acknowledge;It was a journey worth taking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer74;I have booked accommodations for a holiday in the countryside of Alinor, so that I may become well-acquainted with the ways of my Altmer brethren, and prove my purity as an Altmer to all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer74Acknowledge;I cannot wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer75;Verdant hillsides, abundant fruit orchards and awe-inspiring towers serve as the backdrop to a reinvigorating experience! I am treated to calligraphy and sculpting classes, baths in hot springs, delicious Altmeri cuisine and tours of ancient shrines and palaces. But my journey is not complete. I must now prove my comprehension of Altmer culture and my purity before a board of Sapiarchs, the most knowledgeable lords and ladies of my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer75Acknowledge;I am ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer76;I visit an academy where the Sapiarchs reside and enter a circular chamber with a single chair, surrounded by two-dozen or so lecterns. Each lectern is occupied by a single stone-faced, cold-looking Altmer. Each Altmer stands perfectly still, but their austere gazes follow me across the room as I take my seat. They remain completely silent for a few moments, until one who stands directly in front of me speaks plainly. "[Root.GetBestName], your examination hereby commences. The board will begin with queries pertaining to language and etiquette.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer76Acknowledge;The test begins...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer76Title;A Test of Purity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer77;The Sapiarchs ask me questions pertaining to grammar and reading, how to address my betters and my lessers, how to sit, how to dine, how to raise a family and how to honour my ancestors, living and dead, among other subjects. They quietly await my response to each, only for another Sapiarch to ask another question. I stumble through many of my answers, and more than a few responses elicit eye-rolls. Eventually, the Sapiarchs finish their questions and remain silent. The individual at the front of the room speaks up. "The first portion of the examination is complete. The board will continue with queries pertaining to military history, strategies and tactics.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer77Acknowledge;The test continues...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They quietly await my response to each, only for another Sapiarch to ask another question. I confidently give my answers, and several Sapiarchs appear to make slight nods in agreement.

Altmer78Title;A Test of Purity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer79;One by one, the Sapiarchs test my understanding of various military matters, such as the causes of the All-Flags Navy's victory over the Sload of Thras, the Altmer navy's myriad victories against Maormer raiders, how best to manage an army, as well as proper formations and tactics for offensive and defensive battles. As I hesitantly respond, some of the audience furrow their brows and frown. Once the Sapiarchs finish their questions, they briefly stand in silence until the person standing directly in front of me makes an announcement. "The second portion of the examination is complete. The board will continue with queries pertaining to legal and administrative matters.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Altmer81;The Sapiarchs quiz me on law and governance, including such facets as noble duties, taxation, building codes, civil disputes, criminal justice, agricultural production, salaries and contracts, trade agreements and management of resources. I have a great deal of difficulty with some of the questions, and notice sneers and raised eyebrows. After the Sapiarchs conclude their questions, they fall silent for a short duration. The Sapiarch who stands directly in front of me begins to speak. "The third portion of the examination is complete. The board will continue with queries pertaining to political intrigue and esoteric rhetoric.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Altmer82;The Sapiarchs quiz me on law and governance, including such facets as noble duties, taxation, building codes, civil disputes, criminal justice, agricultural production, salaries and contracts, trade agreements and management of resources. The questions do not feel particularly challenging, and I notice several individuals nodding in concordance with my solutions.

Altmer82Title;A Test of Purity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer83;Each of the Sapiarchs bombards me with questions on how to detect conspiracy, identify the suspicious language characteristic of gossip and whispers, protect against espionage and guard one's self from unknown adversaries. I find myself baffled by many of the presented quandaries, but I have enough understanding of subterfuge to identify slight tones of derision in a few of their voices. The Sapiarchs complete their round of questions and wait in silence for the one at the front of the room to talk. "The fourth portion of the examination is complete. The board will continue with queries pertaining to philosophy and magicka.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Altmer84;Each of the Sapiarchs bombards me with questions on how to detect conspiracy, identify the suspicious language characteristic of gossip and whispers, protect against espionage and guard one's self from unknown adversaries. While I answer the questions, I notice that several of the Sapiarchs speak with minimal tones of approval.

The board will continue with queries pertaining to philosophy and magicka.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer84Acknowledge;The test continues...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer84Title;A Test of Purity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer85;The Sapiarchs outline philosophical concepts in such fields as art, astronomy, society, politics, metaphysics and the arcane and demand explanations for each. Once I satisfy their questions, other Sapiarchs in the room name numerous spells and instruct me to demonstrate them, one by one. Unfortunately, my magickal abilities are lacking, and most of the spells fail. I see some Sapiarchs turn up their noses, and some others shake their heads from side to side. Eventually, they all become silent until the Sapiarch who stands directly in front of me talks once more. "The fifth portion of the examination is complete. The board will deliberate and deliver an evaluation of [Root.GetBestName]'s purity." The central Sapiarch conjures two heavily-armoured Dremora and motions for them to escort me out of the chamber. The Dremora do so, re-enter the chamber and close the doors behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Altmer90;I wait just outside the chamber for some time, before the doors eventually swing open and the two Dremora walk out. They escort me back into the chamber, where I am once again greeted by the cold stares of the Sapiarchs, and I sit in the central chair. The individual who spoke in the previous phases of the examination speaks once more. "The deliberation is complete. The board hereby proclaims that you are IMPURE. You are a disgrace to life itself, and your peers will be notified of your base status." The Sapiarch once again motions for the Dremora to escort me out of the chamber. When I return home from my trip, I feel dejected. I also hear my courtiers conversing about my now-infamous impurity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Altmer90Acknowledge;I am still...impure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Altmer91;I wait just outside the chamber for some time, before the doors eventually swing open and the two Dremora walk out.

The individual who spoke in the previous phases of the examination speaks once more. "The deliberation is complete. The board hereby proclaims that you are PURE. Your abilities are questionable, but you are, at the very least, at least as true an Altmer as any of our peasant brethren. Your peers will be notified as such." The Sapiarch once again motions for the Dremora to escort me out of the chamber. When I return home from my trip, I am greeted with dignity and respect. My court is impressed by the news that I am now a true, pure Altmer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You are a shining example of Altmer excellence, and a credit to our people. It is this board's sincerest hope that you encounter nothing but success in your subsequent endeavors, and your peers will be informed accordingly." The Sapiarchs in the chamber smile and politely applaud. When I return home from my trip, I feel confident and happy with who I am, and my court enthusiastically greets me as a true, pure Altmer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Imperials1StewardshipTooltip;Finance a campaign that focuses on infrastructure and construction projects. Soldiers and citizens alike will be encouraged to participate. This will lower tax revenue as well as maximum levy size but dramatically reduce construction costs.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Imperials1Intrigue;Advanced Counterintelligence Operations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Imperials1IntrigueTooltip;Fund the expansion and maintenance of loyal spy networks to discourage and root out hostile acts of espionage. This will modestly lower maximum levy size but make it much more likely to discover plots within the realm.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EKTsaesci15;Your guards visit you in the evening, bringing with them a bowl of crimson blood extracted from [From.GetFirstName]. You eagerly take a sip, but your satisfaction quickly turns to disgust as you realise this blood is horribly corrupt. You spit it out on to the floor, and storm off to [From.GetFirstName]'s dungeon cell for answers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKTsaesci15VampWolf;Your guards visit you in the evening, bringing with them a bowl of crimson blood extracted from [From.GetFirstName].

EKTsaesci15VampVamp;Your guards visit you in the evening, bringing with them a bowl of crimson blood extracted from [From.GetFirstName].

EKTsaesci15WolfWolf;Your guards visit you in the evening, bringing with them a bowl of crimson blood extracted from [From.GetFirstName].
