EVTDESC1000109101;I am extremely lazy, and I never want to do anything. Today, I don’t feel like attending to my official duties.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109101;A nap sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109101;I think I’ll go eat some tasty food.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109101;The work I’ve already done is good enough, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109101;I’m just scared of interacting with others to be honest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109102;I apparently fell asleep while working hard last night. Perhaps I am overworking myself too hard.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109102;Maybe I should take a break…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109102;No! I am not working hard enough!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109102;I will pray to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for strength.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109102;This is nothing, I feel as strong as ever!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109103;While looking for cheap merchandise at the summer fair, you notice a large coin purse lying on the ground. Nobody seemed to notice it, and its owner didn’t seem to be around. You are very much tempted to take it…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109103;Yes! Free money! All mine, all mine!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109103;I should find the purse’s owner and give it back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109103;I’m too lazy to take it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109177;I was about to find who stole my sweetroll!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109177;Hmm... Let's hold court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109103;In the name of justice, I can’t steal this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109104;While browsing merchandise at the summer fair, you come across a young, sweet beggar girl. Her plight moves your heart and you wish to help her in whatever way you can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109104;Give the lass my entire purse.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109104;Bring the girl to a local temple, where the clergy will take care of her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109104;Bring her some of the food from yesterday’s feast immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109104;Hire her as a serving girl. She'll be better off this way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109105;Although I am suffering greatly from an ailment, I don’t really mind it one bit. Strange as some may think of this, I am absolutely content with my current situation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109105;I’ll be happy, whatever comes my way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109105;This is will of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], after all!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109105;Bah, this affliction is nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109105;Everyone suffers, eventually. Why feel anxious about it?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109106;I want to improve my image as a [Root.GetTitle]. If everyone knows me as a great ruler, it will be much easier for me to achieve my ambitions. Thus, I want to be known as a great ruler because of…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109106;My glory and honour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109106;My good and benevolent rule.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109106;My favour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109106;The fear I strike into the hearts of my subjects and enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109107;A silence enveloped the room when I judged the felon to death. It was a sentence I handed out on a whim, even if it was perhaps a bit harsh.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109107;He... he did deserve it, right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109107;I’ll... I’ll just remain silent like everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109108;Throughout the land, the peasants are singing songs in praise of your just rule. Your capable leadership has made the realm a prosperous and affluent place.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109108;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109108;Justice is blind!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109109;Because of your notorious rage, no one in your court dares to criticize you for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109109;I rule my realm as I please.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109109;A good ruler listens to others. Maybe I should control myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109109;But… I want people to trust and love me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109109;In fact, my enemies fear me too!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109110;Being a very patient person, I always try to hear other's opinions before making a decision, because…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109110;Every opinion is flawed. Might as well hear them all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109110;Everyone deserves to be heard.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109110;I am such a great [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109111;I’ve started noticing that everyone is better than me. This isn’t fair! I want to be as good as everyone else – no, even better than everyone, rather. Why am I not the best in everything?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109111;I am worthless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109111;I don’t try hard enough.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109111;No one cares about me, that’s why.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109111;Maybe I shouldn’t worry about this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109112;An impoverished knight had recently died, leaving behind an orphaned child. I really feel pity for the unfortunate youth, who has no family left. I’ll try to find the child a good place to live in.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109112;Send the child to live with one of my trusted knights.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109112;Bring the child to a temple.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109112;Invite the child to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109113;You’ve made a fool of myself while sparring, acting like a full coward in front of the other men.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109113;I can’t help it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109113;I mustn’t embarrass myself like this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109113;It’s actually a tactical trick. IT'S A TRAP!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109114;Today while travelling in the countryside, a member of the Dark Brotherhood tried to kill me, but I defeated the fool with my bare hands. He’s now sitting in my dungeon, awaiting punishment. Meanwhile, my court is praising me for my bravery.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109114;Anyone could have done that.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109114;Even the Dark Brotherhood fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109114;Spare the man and release him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109114;I will torture him personally…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109116;I am no better than anyone. I can always learn something from everyone – even the lowliest beggar or the most foolish imbecile have something to tell me. Today, while surveying a nearby town, one of the peasants taught me a profound lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109116;Humility is the only way to better understand the world, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109117;An ugly wench is throwing herself at you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109117;I don’t care who, I’ll bed any young woman!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109117;Maybe I should have standards after all…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109117;I can’t see her ugliness anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109117;When the lights are blown out, all women are beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109118;One of my new servants happens to be a pretty, innocent young maid, and I can’t get her off my mind. Some of the other men tell me that since I’m a strapping young man, I should accept my natural impulses, but I disagree – I must keep my mind focused on my realm, and I won’t yield, even now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109118;She may be pretty, but I can't let it distract me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109118;[Root.Holder.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will provide me strength against distraction!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109118;I can’t see her, anyway, so how can I admire her?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109118;I don’t like women, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109119;I’m hungry. What should I eat today?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109119;Sweetrolls! Sweetrolls!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109120;Some people say that my temperance prevents me from properly enjoying life, and I should stop being so prudish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109120;Such people are merely fools.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109120;Maybe they have a point.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109120;I don’t enjoy life? Why, I enjoy life all the time!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109121;I thought I just saw a Dark Brotherhood assassin lurking behind the trees over there. A weird, dark shape, behind those leaves… is that a dagger? It must be a dagger!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109121;Wait… I’m just seeing things… I think…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109121;Judging from the angle of the light, it’s just a distortion of my shadow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109121;RUN AWAY!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109122;I’m such a gullible fool. One of my courtiers managed to play a prank on me today!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109122;I have to stop being so gullible.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109122;I don’t mind at all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109122;Punish the miscreant with lashes!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109123;Over the years, I’ve learned to never show anyone my true self. I always have to deceive them, and manipulate them, and while I don’t know whether it’s the right thing to do, it’s a necessity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109123;It’s a danger when people know too much about you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109123;They wouldn’t understand me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109123;They’d think I’m crazy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109123;Nobody would want hear the voices in my head.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109124;While shopping at the summer fair, you realize that one of the merchants isn’t selling a lot of merchandise. After observing him for a while, you realize he is absolutely terrible at advertising his wares and, in your blunt honesty, you criticise him for this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109124;Better improve at this, or you’ll end up a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109124;I’ll buy your products for you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109124;I have some suggestions on how to better advertise your goods…;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109100;Some call me a tyrant, others a monster, but all my subjects fear me and I think that’s a good thing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109100;Blood for the bloody throne.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109100;It is necessary to rule effectively, unfortunately.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109100;I may be tyrannical, but I am fair.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109125;I have to visit my liege, who is currently ill, in order to conduct some official business. I really do not want to go near such a sick person, though - who knows what demons might be trying to possess my liege?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109125;However, I have to finish these errands anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109125;I’ll just not visit. I don’t want demons near me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109125;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] might catch liege's illness;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109127;Your sickness lingers on, and it is difficult for you to do any of your normal duties at all. Instead, you lie in bed most of the time, sneezing and coughing and feeling miserable all around. You wonder how any work can be done when you’re in such a state.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109127;I wish I could get more work done!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109127;I can only pray that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] saves me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109127;Actually, now I have a good excuse to slack off.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109127;No... I must... try to work... even if a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE1000109127;At least I don’t have to deal with annoying people now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109129;I’m still sick, and now I’m even starting to lose my appetite. It looks like I’ll have to start eating gruel now to make myself feel better...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109129;Gruel. So this is what the peasants eat all day?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109129;No! Must... eat... normal... delicious... food... instead...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109129;Gruel? Please, sir, I want some more!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109128;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] vomits from overeating and makes a fool of [Root.GetHerHim]self;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109133;You were just walking down the stairs, carefully measuring your steps due to your blindness. Suddenly, you accidentally overstep and trip, falling down the stairs in one big crash.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109133;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109133;It doesn’t hurt that much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109134;Ever since I was blinded, I’ve been worried that people might be trying to do things behind my back. What if that servant is actually an assassin with a knife right in front of my face? What if my spouse is having an affair under my nose? What if the peasants are mocking me as I travel the countryside?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109134;I better be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109134;My friends will be there to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109134;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will protect me from evil.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109134;Even so, no one would dare get on my bad side.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109135;It’s been a while since I was blinded, and I’ve had time to think about what this means to me. In a way, it is rather depressing. Unlike those who were born blind, and never knew of the beauty of the world in the first place, I can no longer witness this beauty - the vibrant colours, the rich and lush images. I miss my sense of vision.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109135;This just makes me sadder and sadder...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109135;I have to try remembering what things look like.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109135;Perhaps I should sing or compose poetry instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109161;Two of my guards are arguing about whether the Daedra worshippers or Almsivi followers are better. One says that the Almsivi are merely power-hungry, mortal Dunmer. The other says at least the Almsivi aren't incomprehensible like the Daedra. Finally, one of the guards ask me, “What’s your opinion, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109161;The Daedra may give bad results, but at least they're results.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109161;The Almsivi are more personable in my opinion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109161;Neither. All deities are flawed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109161;Everybody has their good points, whether Daedra, Almsivi, men, mer...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109162;While travelling one day, you and your entourage come across a small, ruined monument from antiquity. Upon closer inspection, you and your party determine that the marble columns and masonry date back to either the First or the Merethic Era.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109162;Disgusting. This is where the Elves enslaved our forebears!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109162;We should rebuild this monument here, as a symbol of my power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109162;Just as these monuments lie in ruin, so too shall our monuments lie in ruin one day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109163;Today, merchants from far away have come to the local market, selling delicious fruits, honey-nuts, sweetrolls, and other confectionary and pastries. In particular, the merchants are advertising their delicious sweetrolls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109163;I'll buy the fruit ones there, and the almond ones too!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109163;I love sweetrolls! I’ll buy all of it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109163;I’ll try just a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109163;The Khajiiti-style is particularly scrumptious. I’ll buy some.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109165;One stormy night, an adventurer comes to your castle. He claims after traveling for many years seeking fortune and adventure, he has decided that you would make a worthy master. He thus offers his services to you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109165;I don’t want some low-brow nobody serving me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109165;Very well! But first take a bath...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109170;After months of hard fighting, your troops have managed to squash a local bandit ring near your Capital. However, it has come at a cost - because of your ruthless methods, many of the locals have died in the cross-fighting, and this has made many of them very upset.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109170;Provide compensation to the families.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109170;The ends justify the means!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109170;Torture any peasant that dares speak up against me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109170;Honour the fallen as heroes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109171;While travelling in the countryside, your entourage discovers a small, abandoned fortress. Curious as to what treasures might lie inside, you venture inside, wherein you are immediately ambushed by bandits. Instead of running away, you decide to charge head-on into all the bandits, swinging your sword left and right!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109171;Take that, scum!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109171;No, wait, I can’t do this alone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109172;The woman screams out curses at you as she is dragged to the executioner’s block. “My family will avenge my death and call upon the Dark Brotherhood, you tyrant!” Ignoring her screams, you nod your head to the executioner, who removes her head in one fell swoop.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109172;Anyone who goes against my rule deserves death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109173;People always make fun of me for my strange behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109173;I shouldn’t care about what they say.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109173;I will punish those who dare insult me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109173;Everyone’s opinions should be respected.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109173;Better everyone tells me the truth rather than lie to me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109174;Today, I want to buy something new and exotic to wear from the local market. What colours would fit me?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109174;Perhaps red, to flaunt my power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109174;Blue looks serene and dignified!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109174;How about this yellow one here - golden and prosperous?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109175;You and your party come across the skeleton, half-buried in the mud. Saddened that such a man did not receive a proper burial, you, in your honourable nature, decide to properly bury the skeleton yourself. That night, a ghost comes to you in a dream. Thanking for your kindness, he tells you where his lost treasure is buried.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109175;So... he said walk five hundred steps to the north...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109175;It would be dishonourable to steal such a treasure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109176;You and your entourage come across a horrific scene while patrolling some of the nearby roads: an entire caravan of merchants, massacred, possibly by bandits, necromancers - who knows what! Instead of giving the merchants a proper burial, though, you dishonourably decide to loot all of their belongings first.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109176;What? They’re dead, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109176;I’ll... I’ll try steal a little less this time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109177;I accidentally overheard one of my guards telling another guard about my shoddy appearance. Realizing I am nearby, the man profusely apologises. All that said, I don’t really care what he thinks of my looks.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109177;A ruler has more important concerns, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109177;Only the shallow care about appearances, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109178;Your residence is starting to fall apart. Being a rather industrious person yourself, you cannot bear to let the situation get worse, and you devote yourself to repairing the structure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109178;Bring in some local boys to help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109178;Hire some experts from far away.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109179;Today is an important day. I must finish my work on... oh, look, outside, it’s a mudcrab! Look at that thing! Horrible creatures, aren’t they? Right... oh, wait... Gods damn it, I’m so absent-minded!  What was I going to do again?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109179;Go and pray to [Root.Holder.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109179;Eat some sweetrolls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109179;Find who stole my sweetrolls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109179;Hold court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109005;I’m coming out into this world!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109005;Waaaaah!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109006;After giving birth to my child, you feel as if my energy is being drained, perhaps too much. Everything is getting dark now, and even the voices of people screaming around you are fading away into nothingness. In a short while, you will begin your journey into Aetherius...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109006;Oh [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], at least let my child live!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109007;I’ve died shortly after being born.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109007;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] have mercy on my soul.;;;;;;;;;;;x
