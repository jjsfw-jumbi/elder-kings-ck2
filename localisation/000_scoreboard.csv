DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Septim dynasty. The family line began with the Dragonborn Emperor Tiber Septim, who is widely accepted to be either of Breton or Nord lineage. After accomplishing the unthinkable and uniting Tamriel in 2E 896, Tiber Septim declared the beginning of the Third Era. After his death, Tiber Septim became revered as Talos, one of the Nine Divines. The Septim dynasty reigned over Tamriel for over 400 years through 22 generations, and the totality of Septim rule in Tamriel was characterized by relative peace, prosperity and cosmopolitanism across the entire continent. In 3E 433, the long-reigning Uriel VII and his heirs were assassinated by the Mythic Dawn cult, beginning the Oblivion Crisis. Martin Septim, a son of Uriel's born out of wedlock, emerged from obscurity and ascended to glory as one of the greatest heroes in Tamriel's history. With the help of the Champion of Cyrodiil, Martin transformed into the Avatar of Akatosh and defeated Mehrunes Dagon, banishing the Daedric forces before perishing as a colossal statue. His deeds signified the end of the Septim line, but meant that no Daedric horde could ever plague any nation in Tamriel again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN2_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Dor dynasty. Founded during the First Era by the eponymous Reman, the dynasty is often referred to by its founder's name. Reman's Dragonborn abilities came to light during the Akaviri Invasion of Tamriel, when Tsaesci warriors recognised his gift and swore fealty to him. This ended further hostilities and allowed Reman to establish the Cyrodilic Empire, or "Second Empire" which united much of continental Tamriel. Reman's descendants ruled the Empire for six generations before a "palace coup" resulted in the deaths of its last ruling member, ushering in the dominance of the Akaviri Potentates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN3_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Alessian dynasty. The Alessians were semi-mythical dynasty that ruled the Cyrodiilic Empire for several generations, and claimed descent from Saint Alessia, the liberator of man, though via what means is not actually known. Although their conquests and the size of their Empire pales in comparison to the later Empires, the Alessian legacy endures in the form of the Eight and Nine Divines which are artificial pantheons created by the "marrying" of the Nord traditional gods with the Mer-pantheon of the original proto-Cyrodilics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN4_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Camoran dynasty. One of the most ancient families in all of Tamriel, the Camorans trace their history back to Year Zero of the First Era, when the Bosmer ruler Eplear founded the Kingdom of Valenwood. In the Second Era, they twice joined with the Aldmeri Dominion, first during the reign of Aeradan Camoran in the Sixth Century, and later as a consequence of the crowning of King Camoran Anaxemes in 2E 830. The Camorans presided over Valenwood as vassals of the Septim Empire in the Third Era, with occasional disruptions such as the rise of the Camoran Usurper in 3E 249. Perhaps the most significant Camoran achievements were under the auspices of Mankar Camoran, leader of the Mythic Dawn cult. He and his agents successfully assassinated Emperor Uriel VII and his heirs, stole the Amulet of Kings, and started the Oblivion Crisis in 3E 433. Although he was later slain by the Champion of Cyrodiil and his plans were foiled, Mankar Camoran's actions coincidentally meant that the Camoran dynasty initiated the events that began the First Era, as well as those which ended the Third Era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN5_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Direnni dynasty. Though starting with humble beginnings as a family of Altmer alchemists and farmers, the merchants of the Direnni family shaped an impressive amount of Tamriel's history. Direnni influence began to expand after Asliel Direnni poisoned a barbarian tribe called the Locvar, who consistently raided their homeland of Tyrgiel. In the first era, clan Direnni left Summerset for mainland Tamriel and their wealth exploded, as they gained control of High Rock and some parts of Skyrim and Hammerfell. Soon, their hegemony came into conflict with the emerging, xenophobic Alessian Order. In the Battle of Glenumbra Moors in 1E 482, an army of Direnni, Ayleids, and Nords defeated a more numerous force of Alessians, which directly led to the Order's destruction. Though victorious in this conflict, the Direnni were never able to recover to their past glory, but still remained in Tamriel for several millennia as the wardens of the Adamantine Tower in Balfiera.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN7_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Tharn dynasty. A noble house from Nibenay, the Tharns are first recorded as controlling various territories in the region during the early First Era. Fervidius Tharn ruled as the Arch-Prelate of the mighty Alessian Order starting in 1E 1188. In the Second Era, the immortal sorcerer Abnur Tharn, was one of the preeminent politicians of his day. Abnur served as Chancellor of the Elder Council under numerous rulers, and was one of the Five Companions who located the Amulet of Kings. When Mannimarco used the Amulet to cause the Planemeld in 2E 579, Abnur turned the tables on the lich and helped the Soulless One defeat the Daedric Prince Molag Bal in 2E 582. The Tharns continued as a powerhouse dynasty in Tamriel in the centuries that followed. In 3E 389, Jagar Tharn, Imperial Battlemage to Uriel VII, banished the Emperor to Oblivion and impersonated him for ten years in one of the most chaotic periods in Tamriel's history. Ultimately, the legendary Eternal Champion killed Tharn in 3E 399 and rescued Uriel VII, but the Empire would never fully recover from the carnage inflicted during Jagar's ten-year reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN6_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat Great House Indoril. Founded in the early First Era, Indoril rose to fame under the leadership of the legendary Chimer hero Nerevar, the Hortator who united the people of Resdayn against the Nords, and later defeated the Dwemer during the War of the First Council. Following Nerevar's death at Red Mountain, House Indoril formed a close relationship with the Almsivi to form the bulk of the Tribunal Temple's manpower. House Indoril prospered as one of the strongest Great Houses, with holdings centered in coastal mainland Morrowind.  The fall of the Almsivi and the calamities caused by the eruption of Red Mountain in 4E 5 lessened Indoril's influence substantially, but the Great House remained modestly powerful, retaining its seat on Morrowind's ruling Grand Council during the Fourth Era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN8_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat Great House Redoran. Although not necessarily popular with the other Great Houses, House Redoran of northwestern Morrowind earned respect for its adherence to tradition, its unshakable code of ethics and its steadfast defence of all Dunmer during times of crisis. They tirelessly fought against Dagoth Ur's Blight and raised a Dunmer army against the Daedric forces of Mehrunes Dagon in 3E 433. House Redoran also took charge of the Dunmer in the Fourth Era, raising an army that vanquished the Argonian invasion forces that had sought to exploit the damage caused by the Red Year. Afterwards, House Redoran assumed de facto leadership of Morrowind and its Grand Council, guarding the Dunmer from future hostile incursions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN9_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat Great House Hlaalu. An agrarian and mercantile dynasty with control over the fertile Deshaan region of Morrowind, Hlaalu established itself as a Great House committed to commerce, cosmopolitanism and tolerance. During the First and Second Eras, their policies proved financially advantageous, and during the Third Era, they guaranteed political dominance. House Hlaalu cooperated with the Empire more than any other Great House and was poised to dominate Dunmer politics for the forseeable future. But with the Oblivion Crisis of the Third Era, and the brutal Great War of the Fourth Era, the Empire repeatedly failed to aid its Dunmer subjects in the most critical moments. After the disastrous Red Year and subsequent Argonian invasion, the other Great Houses scapegoated the Hlaalu for their complicity with their Imperial overlords. They stripped their Great House status and kicked them off of the Grand Council, condemning House Hlaalu to permament ignominy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN10_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Ysgramor dynasty. The Ysgramor Dynasty founded the "First Empire" or "Nordic Empire" during the Merethic Era after its founder Ysgramor I led his 500 Companions across the seas from Atmora to carve a new home out of the northern reaches of Tamriel and seek vengeance against savage attacks from the native Snow Elves. Monuments to this dynasty and veneration of its members endured into the Third and Fourth Eras of Tamriel's history, although any living members and dynastic legacy have long since faded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN11_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Mede dynasty. In 4E 17, a Colovian warlord named Titus seized the Imperial City with a force of only a thousand troops during the Stormcrown Interregnum, and was promptly crowned Emperor of Tamriel. Although he was initially unpopular with his new Elder Council, his political allies ingratiated him with the association of nobles and advisors, helping him gradually cement his rule. Titus' son Attrebus was one of the heroes who helped to defeat Vuhon, ruler of the floating city Umbriel, and stop the floating island, saving the people of the Imperial City and countless others from certain doom. Emperor Titus II, a later member of the family, held together a fragmenting Empire against the reformed Aldmeri Dominion during the Great War that raged from 4E 171 to 4E 175. Although Titus II mounted a successful defence aganist the Aldmeri invaders, he was forced to sign the humiliating White-Gold Concordat, which relinquished Hammerfell from Imperial control, banned the worship of Talos in the Empire, and planted the seeds for the Stormcloak Rebellion in 4E 201.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN12_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Arana dynasty. This Altmer house ruled Alinor and the whole of the Summerset Isles as kings and queens during the Second Era. King Hidellith, a long-lived traditionalist and his eccentric, ambitious daughter Queen Ayrenn, are perhaps the two greatest members of the family. Hidellith was a classic ceremoniarch, following every precedent set by the Scrolls of Praxis whenever he possibly could. While he faced a crushing naval defeat against King Orgnum of Pyandonea, Hidellith's long reign was generally remembered by his subjects as a delightfully uneventful one. When he passed in 2E 580, control of Alinor ultimately passed into the hands of his estranged daughter Ayrenn, the Unforeseen Queen, who orchestrated the rise of the First Aldmeri Dominion in 2E 582. A cunning monarch with nerve and diplomatic deftness, she acquired the cooperation of the Bosmer of Valenwood and the Khajiit of Elsweyr. This alliance battled against the Daggerfall Covenant and Ebonheart Pact for control of the Ruby Throne, and helped to defeat the forces of Mannimarco and Molag Bal to end the Planemeld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN13_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Gardner dynasty. A merchant clan, the Gardners first rose to fame under the leadership of Farangel, who oversaw the shift of Wayrest from a burgeoning city-state into a true kingdom in 1E 1100. Deft leadership from the Gardner rulers, boosted by Wayrest's fabulous wealth, allowed the family to act as a dominant political and economic force in High Rock until well into the Second Era. The spread of the Knahaten Flu was the downfall of the Gardners, who were all wiped out by the disease in 2E 563. Although Wayrest fell into the hands of the Cumberlands, a vassal dynasty, the Gardners continued to be remembered throughout Tamriel for achievements such as their successful defence of High Rock against the Reachmen Invasion of 2E 541, and the subsequent signing of the original Daggerfall Convenant, an alliance of Breton states, just a year later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN14_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Cumberland dynasty. The Cumberlands began as vassals of the mercantile Gardner dynasty of Wayrest, faithfully serving their lieges in wartime. Emeric Cumberland, who famously slew the Reachman warlord Durcorach the Black Drake during the Battle of Daggerfall in 2E 541, was crowned King of Wayrest in 2E 563 after the utter demise of the Gardner line. But Emeric's greatest achievement was his skillful establishment of the Second (or Greater) Daggerfall Covenant in 2E 566. By gaining a marriage alliance with the Redguards and earning the loyalty of the Orcs by proposing a new Orsinium, Emeric assumed the leadership of one of the three factions that helped save Tamriel from the Planemeld in 2E 582.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN15_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat the Vasenon dynasty. The Vasenon family underwent a rapid rise and fall during the Sixth Century of the Second Era. Durcorach the Black Drake, a tenacious and relentless warlord, emerged from the craggy mountains of of the Reach with a huge army of witchmen that poured into Cyrodiil, took the Ruby Throne and saw the Durcorach crowned Emperor of Cyrodiil. Durcorach married Veraxia Tharn to improve his legitimacy and immediately set his sights on High Rock. The Black Drake tormented the Bretons until his death at the Battle of Daggerfall in 2E 541. Durcorach and his successors, the so-called "Longhouse Emperors," controlled Cyrodiil until just a few years before the Planemeld. Durcorach's fervent descendant Leovic was a devout worshipper of the traditional Reachmen pantheon and legalised Daedra worship throughout the Empire, sparking a rebellion that saw the end of Vasenon rule in Cyrodiil, and the ascension of the Colovian Emperor Varen Aquilarios.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
