The law was promulgated despite protests from the Elder Council, lead by High Chancellor Abnur Tharn, the Emperor's own father-in-law. While you, [Root.GetTitledNameWithNick], is currently a supporter of the Emperor, your Colovian blood boils as you hear of Leovic's heretic laws. The local clergy, as well as representatives from other Colovian states, urge you to present an ultimatum to the Emperor, requesting Leovic to step down and exile himself back in the Reach.

He asks you to peacefully handle over any Imperial titles and self-exile in Markarth, as ruler of an independent Reach. The Elder Council, already outraged by your outlandish laws, urges you to accept the kind Colovian offer.
