amulet_draconian_madstone_desc;The Draconian Madstone is an ancient Tsaesci amulet said to grant the wearer protection from disease and poison, it was a prized possession of the snakemen's Empresses, a symbol of their authority much in the same way as the Amulet of Kings represented the authority of the Emperors of Tamriel. It was bequeathed to the General of the Tsaesci Invasion at the end of the first era by the Empress who hoped it would protect the man, her son, on his grand campaign. Unfortunately the Amulet, along with the General and his army, was seemingly lost to history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

amulet_of_necromancer;Necromancer's Amulet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amulet_of_necromancer_desc;The Necromancer's Amulet is a legendary item created by Mannimarco, the King of Worms. In appearance it is an exquisite amulet, often with a skull emblazoned upon it, though it's shape seems to shift with each new owner. It grants the wearer a measure of protection almost equal to wearing fullplate without the additional burden, as well as regeneration from injury. The wearer also becomes wise beyond his years and far more capable as a Spellcaster. This comes at a price however, as the amulet exacts a tax upon it's wearer's health, slowly degenerating them until they become little more than a husk. The amulet is unstable in this world, and is forever doomed to fade in and out of existence, reappearing at locations distant from that of its disappearance, although some say this is intentional, the Amulet abandoning it's owner when it has all but drained the very last breathes from them in it's seemingly unending search for it's original master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

amulet_of_necromancy_desc;A dark amulet, said to hold power over the undead.

These days they are sought after by Merchants, Nobles and others who seek their beguiling powers over servants and vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kambition100o2;I should not disturb the dead. I'll send someone else instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition100o2tt1;You seek out an Adventurer from your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition100o2tt2;You announce a call for Adventurers to undertake a quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition101d;My liege seeks the Amulet of Kings, one of the most prized symbols of rulership in Tamriel amongst the adherrents of the Divines and the ancient pact made by Saint Alessia. They have tasked me to undertake this hallowed quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition101o1;To Sancre Tor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition101o2;This quest is not mine to undertake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition102d;My liege! I will gladly undertake the quest to retrieve the Amulet of Kings from Sancre Tor. I will need funds to purchase provisions for the journey, and will then set out forthwith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition102tt;[From.GetBestName] prepares for the quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition103d;Preparations for my journey to Sancre Tor are completed. I have gathered my supplies, weapons and my few companions to accompany me and the long road stands before us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition103o;Onwards, to adventure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition104d;It seems the other adventurers at court have declined to undertake your quest. You will have to either go yourself, or find someone else to do it for you from out of court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition104o1;I suppose if you want something done, you do it yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition104o2;Send out a call ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition10d;While browsing the wares you come across a pair of enchanted gauntlets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition10o;Ah these will do nicely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition11d;While browsing the wares you come across an ancient suit of Dragonbone Armour that is in almost pristine condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition11o;Yes, this will do nicely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition12d;While browsing the wares you come across a fairly ordinary looking Herder's Crook, however the Merchant is quick to inform you of its storied past as the enchanted item wielded by an ancient Shepard-King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition13d;While browsing the wares you come across an ornate ring. Upon closer inspection you are positive it is the Warlock's Ring, an item enchanted and worn by the ancient legendary figure Syrabane!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition14d;While browsing the wares you come across a very finely forged Orcish weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition14o;Hahaha! Most excellent! I'll take it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition150d;After successfully arriving at Sancre Tor I began breaking the locks on the catacomb doors. The noise I made attracted a group of local guards, outnumbered I was forced to surrender and now rot in the prison of the local Lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition151d;"A bedraggled looking courier hands you a note, "My liege, I was a companion of [From.GetBestName] on their quest to obtain the Amulet of Kings. Upon our arrival at the catacombs [From.GetBestName] was apprehended by the local lord!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition152d;Your guards report having arrested an individual attempting to break into the Catacombs beneath Sancre Tor in search of the Amulet of Kings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition152o;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition154d;"A courier delivers a note, "To whom it may concern, I am a member of the Sancre Tor Guard writing to inform you of the death of [From.GetBestName]. We discovered their remains on the road to the Catacombs, all belongings ransacked save a parchment bearing the insignia of your Court."";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition155d;A party of adventurers have answered your call. They stand ready to retrieve the Amulet of Kings from the Catacombs of Sancre Tor, but they ask a high price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition155o1;I will pay their asking price, I must have the Amulet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition155o2;I'll pay more than they are asking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition155o3;I cannot afford what they are asking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition156o2;I'll have to find another way of obtaining the Amulet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition157d;The so-called Adventurers you paid to retrieve the Amulet of Kings had not been heard from for months when a Guard brought one in dressed in rags. Apparently they weren't adventurers at all but a band of local thieves and vagabonds who had played you for a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition157o;What!? How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition158d;Out of the half a dozen adventurers you paid to retrieve the Amulet of Kings, only one has returned to your Court months after first setting out. He is missing an eye and his face is horrifically scarred. Their quest has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition158tt;The adventurer decides to stay at your court, at least for awhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition159d;Out of the half a dozen adventurers you paid to retrieve the Amulet of Kings, only two have returned to your Court. They do not come emptied handed however, their quest has succeeded and the Amulet of Kings is yours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition159o;Now the Amulet is mine, Tamriel will follow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition159tt;The Adventurers decide to remain at your Court, at least for awhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition15d;While browsing the wares you come across a very finely crafted, ornately engraved Elven weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition161d;The Undead have overwhelmed my party! I have escaped into a small side-chamber but there is no escape. I can hear their bony fingers scraping at the door. My end is near...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition161o;I shall not see dawn's beauty again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition162d;You encounter a group of undead, the guardians of this catacomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition162o;Fight them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition163d;You head deeper into the Catacombs. After several hours you come across a large chamber. Wards cover all entrance points and you can see dozens of traps surrounding the ornately decorated coffins in the centre of the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition163o;This is what I have come here for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition164d;You prevail over the Undead granting them final rest, in pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition166d;[From.GetBestName] has returned victorious! Tired and weary they stand before you holding the amulet of kings in their hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition166o;You have done well [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition167d;Your liege commends you for your service, you have undertaken a great quest in their name and retrieved the Amulet of Kings. Surely they would not refuse you a reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition167o1;I will ask for a title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition167o2;I will ask for monetary reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition167o3;I will ask for their daughter's hand in marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition167o4;I will ask for no reward, all I did was my duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition168d;[From.GetBestName] has requested in payment of his service that he be granted a noble title you currently hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition168o1;I'm sure I have a title around here to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition168o2;You ask for too much, your life is reward enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition169d;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has granted your request for a title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition16d;While browsing the wares you come across a rare, highly prized weapon forged from volcanic Glass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition170d;Your liege has refused your request for a reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition170o;After all I did for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition171o1;A small fortune is the least they deserve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition173d;[From.GetBestName] has requested the hand of your daughter in marriage as reward for their services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition173o1;What's a daughter compared to the Amulet of Kings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition174d;Your liege congratulates you on the marriage to their daughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition17d;While browsing the wares you come across a suit of Mithril Armour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition18d;While browsing the wares you come across a suit of ornately decorated Elven Armour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition19d;While browsing the wares you come across a suit of Dwarven Armour. The veneer is a little scuffed but the plating itself is in almost pristine condition, a testament to its construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition1d;You have recently decided to become a collector of rare artifacts. Why should everyone else enjoy the benefit of a finely crafted, ornately decorated Elven Weapon and not you?\n You overhear one day a Courtier talking of a local Merchant who deals in such rare artifacts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition1o1;I shall visit this Merchant and see what they have in stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition1o1tt;You set off for the local market...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition1o2;For all I know this Merchant could be a charlatan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition1o2tt;You decide not to visit the local market.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition20d;While browsing the wares you come across a suit of masterfully crafted Orcish Armour, surely one of the best suits of Armour in Tamriel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition21d;While browsing the wares you come across a Magickal Staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition22d;While browsing the wares you come across the Shimsil, an enchanted ebony shortsword that is highly prized by assassins and other shadowy folk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition23d;While browsing the wares you come across an enchanted Dwarven Halberd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition2d;The Merchant you overheard about has his own shop at the end of the market, you make your way there. Upon entering you see a large room with many shelves, each shelf is stacked with various seemingly random items many of which you are sure are pretty worthless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition2o1;Browse the wears looking for something interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition2o1tt;You browse the wears and find...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition30d;You take a wrong turn as you head to the market and find yourself in a dark alley. You are quickly surrounded by a group of thugs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition30o1;Use your magick to scare the thugs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kambition31d;"The Bandits disperse, leaving you alone in the darkened alley. "That was lucky." You think to yourself.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition31ott;You continue on to the market.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition32d;Your attempts to do avail you from your situation. The Bandits laugh at your efforts and thoroughly beat you, leaving your bloodied and pillaged in the alley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition3d;Browsing the wares you come across a few interesting baubles but nothing truely impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition3o;Well...I could always do with some more of these...oh and those!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition3o1;I might as well buy something, I don't want to leave empty handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition4d;You browse the wears and find an mildly interesting necklace. Upon closer inspection you realise it is a religious medallion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition4o;Oh, shiney!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition50d;"Today a strange, grey-haired individual in a purple suit showed me three chests of different sizes, "Choose a chest and win a prize, and it may just be a wonderful surprise... or not, in which case you might appear a clown...or is it a cloud? In either case hurry up and pick or I'll pluck out your eyes!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition51d;"You open the chest and are immediately assaulted by the foul stench of an extremely potent cheese. "Wonderful! Time for a celebration... Cheese for everyone!" The grey-haired man vanishes along with his chests. Moments later you hear the sound of a million wheels of cheese falling from the skies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition51o;Cheese... cheese EVERYWHERE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition52d;"You open the chest and are immediately assaulted by a strong smell of almonds. Moments later you find it hard to catch your breath... "Are you dead yet? I hate indecision! ... or maybe I don't!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition52o;Hurk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition53d;"You open the chest and find inside a pile of squishy intestines. "... and OUT comes the intestines! And I skip rope with them!" The grey-haired man demonstrates, before vanishing into thin air.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition53o;... That was disgusting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition54d;"You open the chest to find it full of jewels, sparkling in the light. "Jewels? How boring... boring, boring, BORING!" The man disappears in a flash, taking his chests with him but leaving the jewels to crash to the floor.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition55d;"You open the chest to find a Dwemer Puzzle Cube within. "Enjoy your gift! Tata for now!" The man disappears in a flash.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition56d;"You open the chest to find a few pieces of Dragonbone within. "I once knew a dragon but he was lost to time. Tata for now!" The man disappears in a flash.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition57d;"You open the chest to find a large decorated egg. "Time to go I guess, let me check everything. Clothes? Check. Beard? Check! Luggage? Now where did I leave my luggage?"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition58d;"You open the chest to find a desiccated hand of a vampire, "I once knew a vampire, he was such a bore, so I tore off his arms and fed the rest to a boar!" The grey-haired man disappears into thin air.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition59d;"You open the chest to find a Black Hands Dagger, "Ta ta for now!" The grey-haired man says as he vanishes.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition5d;While browsing the wares you come across the head of a very fine specimen of a beast. It would certainly look good above your fireplace, and if people were to infer that you had been the one to kill it...well who's to know any better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition5o;It certainly would look very good above my fireplace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition60d;"You open the chest to find the Haynek Fang, "Oh, the Fang, I'd be careful with that one. It has a bite worse than its bark! Wait, it's not a tree? Well Ta ta for now!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition61d;"You open the chest to find... an Elder Scroll within? "Oh dear, how did that get in there? Oh fiddlesticks, ah well. Read that and I won't have to pluck out your eyes, it'll do it for me! Ta ta for now!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition62d;"You open the chest to find the Ring of Phynaster, "Ta ta for now!" The grey-haired man says as he vanishes.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition63d;"You open the chest to find a fairly plain looking mace. "It may look very plain but it's the Clutterbane! Ta ta for now!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition64d;"You open the chest and a snake darts out, its venomous fangs dripping as it writhes before you. "You're making my teeth itch, and hers too!" The grey-haired man says as he vanishes.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition65d;"You open the chest and... to your surprise you find a baby within sound asleep. "That's not one of mine, I'm...fairly sure. Well now it's one of yours! Ta ta!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition66d;"You open the chest and find a single leaf of paper inside. You read it and to your surprise it clearly shows you are the rightful Emperor of Tamriel. "I'm so happy I could just tear out your intestines and strangle you with them!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition67d;"You open the chest and find it filled with swirling light, "The Isles. THE ISLES! They're a wonderful place to be, except when they are horrible. Then they are HORRIBLY WONDERFUL! Good for a visit! Or for an eternity." He pushes you into the swirling light.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition68d;"As you open the chest, a large angry sabrecat jumps from within, mauling you to pieces before it jumps out the window. "Whoops! I guess the cat's out of the bag on that one! Who puts cats in bags anyhow? Cats HATE bags... apparently chests too, HA!" The man laughs and disappears.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition69d;"You open the chest to find a bound and gagged person inside, "That's where I put him, I wondered where he went. More brains than a brain pie, but terribly boring. Why, Brain Pie...what a fantastic idea! Ta ta!" He disappears leaving the gagged individual.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition6d;You browse the wears and find an intricate map of Tamriel. You are amazed at its detail and the obvious love the cartographer poured into his creation. Upon closer inspection you see the initials of Lord Arthmodeus, the Chief Cartographer under the Potentate Savirien-Chorak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition6o;Beautiful, I'll take it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition70d;"You open the chest to find a collection of rare, abstract paintings. "That's where they went! Painted by a blind artist with a brush from that hussy Dibella! He screamed so loud when I plucked out his eyes, such a noisy baby... Well, Ta ta for now!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition71d;Your attempts to tame the snake fail and it lashes out, biting deeply into your flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition72d;Your attempts to tame the snake succeed. It coils around your arm, becoming a living bracer, with fangs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition7o;These bones must be ancient. I'll take them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition8d;While browsing the wares, a dwemer puzzle box catches your eye. You've never seen something quite like it before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition8o;Intriguing, very intriguing. I'll take it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kambition9d;While browsing the wares, you come across something wrapped in a stained cloth. You unwrap it and at first think it's a monkey's hand however the Merchant is quick to inform you it is the dessicated hand of a Vampire Lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kflavour1000d;The Imperial City Guard, valiant defenders of the Imperial Isle and its citizens have been called up to defend the island against hostile enemies by taking the battle to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1001d;With conflict having drawn to a close the Imperial Guard has returned to its peace time duties as the enforces of law and peace within and around the Imperial Isle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1001o;It's a shame they're only part time soldiers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1010d;The captain of a group of lesser known sellswords is offering the services of his men in your current conflict. Their arms could be very useful to bolster our Army but they are quite expensive, if we refuse to hire them however they may offer their services to someone else in the conflict, possibly even our enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1010o1;Hire them, I could always use more swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1010o2;I have no need of sellsword vagabonds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1011d;The captain of a group of lesser known sellswords is offering the services of his men to our armies. Apparently he was spurned by our enemies and is now offering his services to us to spite them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1025d;Awaking one day you make your way over to one of your most prized possessions, a magical coffer that once belonged to the Maormer Wizard-King, Orgnum. Much to your alarm the coffer seems to have disappeared, in its place a small pile of gold sits left as it were a parting gift. It seems the myths about the coffer mysteriously disappearing one day are true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1025o;But...but...all the money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1026d;While rummaging around one day in the wilds you come across a small coffer in pristine condition, just lying there in the middle of nowhere. You feel drawn to its unassuming appearance, as if it were calling out to you. Upon returning home one you show the coffer to a local specialist on artifacts who seems fairly certain it is the fabled coffer of the Wizard-King Orgnum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1026o;My precious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour10d;The Merchant recently delivered a very large purse of Gold, thanking me for my investment which has proven to be a great boon to their business. Shortly after I made my investment, a mysterious stranger delivered a large collection of rare and highly valuable ancient Ayleid, Dwemer and Daedric artifacts which the merchant purchased with my funds. He then sold these artifacts at far above market value, earning quite a nice profit in the process...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour11d;One of your accountants has noted a discrepancy in the treasury books and has adjusted the numbers accordingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour11o;Did I just lose money?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1200d;"The Captain bursts into my room aboard his ship, "My Liege! Some of the crew have come down with a mysterious flu! I fear the dreaded Knahaten has followed us to the seas!"";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1200o;We're doomed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1200oc1;Sea Sick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1200oc2;Sea Sick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1201d;Thankfully after the ship's Surgeon had a chance to look over the sick crew he attributed it to a batch of bad gruel. The ship's cook has been thoroughly disciplined, although this case of dysentery is still doing its rounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1201o;I feel a bit queer myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1202d;The Ship's Surgeon has barricaded himself in his room and refuses to come out, warding himself against illness as best he can. The Knahaten Flu is upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1202o;I tried to run, but alas it has claimed me still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour12d;Thieves have struck and made off with a small amount of your treasury before the Guards were roused from their slumber!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour12o1;Damn those Guards sleeping on the job!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour12o2;Their napping cost me so I will take the debt from their flesh. Remove their eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1300d;My faith in the gods has been shaken as of late and I don't feel the urge to visit a shrine or pray any more. I've become more and more cynical and I feel truly disconnected from any kind of divinity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1300o1;Perhaps these supposed gods are just very powerful mages after all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1300o2;I should undertake a spiritual quest to regain my faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1301d;I have completed a spiritual journey and returned with renewed, stronger faith. My experiences have shown me that while the Gods may not always listen, they are at least always with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1301o1;My faith in the Gods is strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1302d;My liege invited me to a private audience, attended by only [Root.Liege.GetHerselfHimself] and [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] Spymaster. They offered me the position of Court Assassin, my unique skills qualifying me for this dark duty. To kill a man in defence or war is one thing but to assassinate them in their bed at night, or worse be sent after their children and heirs for the whims of my liege... I don't know if this is something I could do and keep my own sanity in tact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1303o1;My liege has asked and I must accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1303o2;This position goes against my beliefs, I must refuse it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour13d;Time for a celebration... Cheese for everyone! Wait, scratch that. Cheese for no one. That can be just as much of a celebration, if you don't like cheese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1d;While holding a great feast one of your courtiers introduces a gentlemen with a business proposition. The gentlemen happens to own several tracts of land in a frontier province of your realm, he wishes to develop the infrastructure of the land to turn it into an economically viable region and is looking for investors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1o1;Hm an interesting proposition, I believe I can spare some coin to invest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour1o2;I have no interest in investing in your scheme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour2d;Several months after you made an investment into a development scheme you sent out couriers to locate the gentlemen to whom you gave your gold. Unfortunately none of the couriers were able to find the man, and the land he claims to have been developing appears to be little more than a stagnant swamp filled with goblins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour2o;I've been played for a fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour3d;Several months after you invested in his development scheme the Merchant returns to your court. He brings good news, by using your funds and that of other investors he has successfully improved the infrastructure in [Root.GetName], trade flows through the streets as caravans and common people alike make use of the new roads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour4d;Several months after you invested in his development scheme the Merchant returns to your court. He brings excellent news, not only has he managed to improve the infrastructure in [Root.GetName] but through wise investments of his own he has managed to recover much of the money invested and feels it only right to share this boon with some of his preferred investors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour6d;"As you twist and turn an innocuous bauble, a merchant catches your eye. He makes a proposition to you, "Invest in my shop and I'll have enough gold to buy new, exquisite items, and in return I can offer you and your Court a fair discount on future transactions and I might even put a little extra into my taxes...".";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour6o1;Yes an investment sounds wise, but do not play me for a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour6o2;An excellent idea, I'll invest above what the Merchant is asking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour6o3;I have more pressing economical concerns than investing in a flea market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour7d;The Merchant recently delivered a purse of Gold. They thanked me for their investment and wanted to share a portion of their recent profits with me in thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kflavour8d;The Merchant recently delivered a large purse of Gold, thanking me for my investment which has proven to be a great boon to their business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

pet_dog_dunehound_desc;"Game is scarce amid the dunes of the Alik'r Desert, and tracking prey across the sands is no simple task.

pet_dog_warhound;Imperial Warhound;;;;;;;;;x
pet_dog_warhound_desc;Loyal, savage, steadfast. These are some of the words used to describe the Imperial Warhound. The foundation myth of the breed dates back to the time of Reman I, it was said when he needed loyal men to fight his first battles, none could be found and so he looked to the Wolves of Cyrodiil to aid him. The modern Imperial Warhounds are unrecognisable from Wolves, they are larger and some would say even more fearsome than their primitive cousins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pet_dog_wolf;Wolf;;;;;;;;;x
pet_dog_wolf_desc;"A Wolf, a predatory carnivore that often hunts and lives in packs. Though they are rightly feared as intelligent, deadly hunters Wolves rarely attack sentient beings unless they feel threatened or starved, likely sensing that doing so is more danger than it's worth. Whomever has managed to gain the fealty of a Wolf however is certainly an interesting individual, for although Dogs are descended from ancient Wolves, Wolves themselves are notoriously difficult to "break", never relinquishing their animalistic nature for long.";;;;;;;;;x

pet_goose_desc;Geese have been domesticated all over Nirn for their eggs, meat, feathers, and as guard animals.

pet_guineapig;Highland Cavy;;;;;;;;;x
pet_guineapig_desc;A corpulent, fuzzy rodent that spends much of its time gorging itself on hay and vegetables. Cavies tend to be extremely docile and this one is no exception - it curls up next to its owner and squeaks contentedly when petted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pet_horker;Horker;;;;;;;;;x
pet_horker_desc;Although a common sight along Skyrim's frigid coast, Horkers are rarely ever kept as pets, and for good reason - they need open space with access to water, and can be aggressive towards strangers.

pet_lungshark;Markamal Lungshark;;;;;;;;;x
pet_lungshark_desc;Native to Akavir's southernmost seas, the Markamal Lungshark is the largest member of several species of cold-water sharks that can tolerate sub-zero temperatures and possess the unique ability to breathe both water, and air. Kamal beliefs consider Lungsharks - who are adept at living on land, are seemingly immune to disease, and can survive for hundreds of years - to be avatars of sheer force of will. It's not entirely certain how this monstrosity was tamed, but it seems just intelligent enough to recognize (and savagely protect) its master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

relsym.1.d;Many times as we lay beside one other, exhausted from our play, [friend_of_another_religion.GetFirstName] and I have conversed over many topics but none have held as much passion as our respective faiths. Though neither of us is willing to acknowledge the superiority of the other's religion, we have at least found a respect for each other's beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The last thing you ever saw was all those you held dear torn apart before you, and yourself shortly joining them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
