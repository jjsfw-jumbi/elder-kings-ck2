Modifier definitions are used for making custom modifiers.
These are based around other script objects, like special units, cultures, etc.
The code associates specific names with specific modifiers, but for them to work in-game, they have to be defined in this folder. You can define modifiers not associated with anything, but they won't do anything other than show in the UI.
This also allows defining a number of parameters regarding how the modifier will be displayed.

== Structure ==
horse_archers_offensive = { # The name of the modifier. Should match some script object, in this case "horse_archers" + "_offensive"
	show_as_percent = yes 	# Show it as a percentage boost, rather than a regular number. Automatically multiplies it by 100 for display as well
	is_good = yes			# Show positive numbers in green
	is_monthly = no			# Add a "(monthly)" to the display	
	is_hidden = no			# Don't show it at all
	max_decimals = 2		# How many numbers after the decimal point to show
	show_value = no			# Whether to show its value at all. Setting to "no" can be useful for showing a modifier unlocks some sort of feature. Note it will only show up when the modifier is not equal to zero
}

== Objects modifiers can be used with ==
Custom modifiers can be used with a variety of objects. This is a hopefully complete list.

Special units:
<name> - Defines the modifier providing the troop itself. E.G., "horse_archers". It's what you'd use in the building giving the special unit
<name>_offensive - Defines the unit's offensive modifier. E.G., horse_archers_offensive
<name>_defensive - Defines the unit's defensive modifier
<name>_morale - Defines the unit's morale modifier

Cultures:
<culture>_opinion - Gives opinion bonus with specified culture, E.G., norse_opinion
<culture_group>_opinion - Gives opinion bonus with specified group, E.G., north_germanic_opinion

Religions:
<religion>_opinion - Gives opinion bonus with specified religion, E.G., catholic_opinion
<religion_group>_opinion - Gives opinion bonus with specified group, E.G., muslim_opinion

Traits:
<trait>_opinion - Gives opinion bonus with persons who have specified trait, E.G., genius_opinion
opinion_of_<trait> - Makes the character like characters who have the specified trait, E.G., opinion_of_lustful

Offmap currency:
The name of this token is defined in the offmap itself. Gives monthly offmap currency

== Localisation ==
The key of the modifier will be used for localisation to show in modifier breakdowns. Example:
horse_archers_OFFENSIVE_FIRE;Horse Archers Attack;Archers montés – Attaque;Ber. Bogenschützen - Angriff;;Ataque de arqueros montados;;;;;;;;;x
You can also define the loc key plus "_EXPLANATION" to show an explanation in places that sum up different modifiers (E.G., opinion breakdowns). Example:
opinion_of_lustful_EXPLANATION; (opinion of Lustful);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
