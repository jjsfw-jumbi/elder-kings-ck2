# TODO:JJ Replace current monthly finance maintenance with an on_offmap_monthly_pulse action - the Ideal Masters are doing the Council's bookkeeping, I guess

# N.B. a number of these are vague ideas rather than proper TODO/planned items
# TODO:JJ AI High Chancellors/Emperors receive an event each decade to have a 66% (?) chance to propose a law change instead of taking the decisions
# they do take the decisions if they have the currency, increase AI currency gain (is that even possible? give them a little boost on the yearly maintenance event instead?)
# TODO:JJ increase councilism if many imperialist policies are in place
# TODO:JJ vice versa with imperialism for councilist laws (?) (to a lesser degree)
# TODO:JJ allow an empowered Council to make the Emperor a puppet, start road to Potentate
# TODO:JJ if members of the Council are arrested, executed, etc by the Emperor have it cause unhappiness
# TODO:JJ change Council starting laws based on date (ongoing process)
# TODO:JJ vetoing motions that would increase Imperial power have no malus
# TODO:JJ "weakened the Elder Council" opinion malus like that of Conclave council
# TODO:JJ contrariwise, opinion bonus for increasing Elder Council power
# TODO:JJ special focus decision for Emperor - external (+troop count, -imp influence and taxes) v. internal (-troop count, +imp influence and taxes) or something like that

# TODO:JJ only apply law cooldown when a law passes (different cooldown for when pass/fails?) (?)
# TODO:JJ consequences for waging war against councillors when Emperor

# TODO:JJ idea from MeGaMaN - decision to form East Empire Company
# officials are supposed to be appointed, would a MR really represent it well? Modifiers instead, managed by the steward/minor title??

# TODO:JJ Et tu, Brute? VERY unhappy Elder Council effects

# These ones aren't EC related, just a todo list

# Notes on realm law legislation
# When both effect and pass_effect are called, the old law is still technically in place for triggers, but both are called after the law is passed by the council
# However, the on law passed on action is both instant and occurs with the new law in place
# So, in the effect block, clear all old flags and set a flag marking the old law

# To prepare laws:
# 1. add check in allow block to see if the Council is voting
# 2. add tooltip in effect to indicate what, if any, action the Elder Council will take
# 2. set flag in in effect to indicate that a vote is taking place and to indicate what the old law was
# 2.5 DO NOT TOUCH PASS EFFECT IT IS EVIL but really there's nothing that needs to be done there
# 3. on law passed on_action event for imperial veto chance (1300), notifications and implement law if used
# 4. HC event based on what the new law is, revert passed law to old one to prevent abuse of time between realm ratification and Council ratification
# 5. trigger the normal councillor vote chain event from the event in 4. based on previous law
# 6. give yourself a pat on the back and have a lovely day <3 (or repeat ad nauseam :(  )

# Imperial Veto
# For realm laws, the Emperor can veto the Elder Council's deliberations on whether to approve it, forcing the law to take effect
# For Council laws, the Emperor can veto a motion proposed by the HC, preventing the vote from taking place.
# The Emperor CANNOT veto Council laws into effect

# Realm Laws
# TODO:JJ council laws - try to have a single inc/dec chain pair used for *all* council realm laws
# TODO:JJ obligations - stretch goal >.<
